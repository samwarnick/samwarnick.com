- Hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
- Built with:
  - [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org)
    - Vue is my favorite JS framework.
  - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind), "a utility-first CSS framework".
    - I also use [PurgeCSS](https://www.purgecss.com/) with Tailwind to remove any unused CSS to create very small CSS files.
