## This Site

- Hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
- Built with:
  - [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), currently in Alpha, VuePress generates static sites from Vue and Markdown files.
    - Vue is my favorite JS framework.
    - Uses the [blog plugin](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/plugin/official/plugin-blog.html) to create posts similarly to how Jekyll works.
    - Uses [vuepress-plugin-sitemap](https://github.com/ekoeryanto/vuepress-plugin-sitemap) to create a sitemap.
  - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind), "a utility-first CSS framework".
    - I also use [PurgeCSS](https://www.purgecss.com/) with Tailwind to remove any unused CSS to create very small CSS files.
