        <p>
          My blog has moved around a lot. Most recently (and only for a couple
          months), I was using a self-hosted
          <a href="https://ghost.org/developers/" class="external-link"
            >Ghost</a
          >
          instance on DigitalOcean. As much as I liked Ghost, I was looking for
          something a little more hands off—I didn't love being greeted with a
          new update notification nearly every time I logged in, requiring me to
          SSH in and upgrade. I also wanted something I could manage a little
          more easily from my iPad. Not for any good reason; just for fun. A
          friend of mine has always suggested I try out GitHub Pages and Jekyll,
          so I decided to try it out. Now, I haven't been on GitHub pages for
          very long, so these are just my initial thoughts.
        </p>
        <h3>GitHub Pages and Jekyll</h3>
        <p>
          GitHub pages is a simple way to host a personal site. It just uses a
          repo on GitHub and
          <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="external-link">Jekyll</a> to
          build a static site. Basically, all you have to do is provide the
          files for Jekyll to build. At it's simplest, all you need is an
          <code>index.html</code>. Like they say on the
          <a href="https://pages.github.com" class="external-link"
            >GitHub Pages</a
          >
          site:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Just edit, push, and your changes are live.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here are a few pros and cons for me:</p>
        <h4>Pros</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Free</li>
          <li>Easy to setup</li>
          <li>Dead simple and doesn't come with a ton of bloat</li>
          <li>Built in version control, because, you know...GitHub</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cons</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Can't preview drafts</li>
          <li>
            Doesn't support SSL and HTTPS with custom domains (you can use
            <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com" class="external-link"
              >Cloudflare</a
            >
            as a workaround)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I enjoy being able to just push changes to my repo and not having to
          deal with SSH or Mosh or FTP or whatever. For me, it's by far the
          simplest solution I've come across. GitHub even emails you if there's
          a problem build the files you've just pushed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Jekyll is a static site generator, it's obviously not going to
          be the right solution for every project, but for a simple blog, it's
          pretty perfect. I'm able to make page templates in HTML and the
          <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" class="external-link"
            >Liquid</a
          >
          templating language, all my styling in SCSS, and write my posts in
          Markdown. Mostly, I followed the
          <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/" class="external-link"
            >Jekyll docs</a
          >
          to build my own theme. Since Jekyll sites don't come with a ton of
          bloat, it was quite easy to make a theme. Not a whole lot to worry
          about. I made a <code>default</code> layout and a
          <code>post</code> layout which extends the <code>default</code>. The
          <code>default</code> has all the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> stuff, the
          header and footer, and a place to put the body content, so the other
          layouts I make don't have to worry about that stuff because they just
          extend it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jekyll can also have plugins. GitHub has several useful plugins
          whitelisted. They have some by default plugins like
          <code>jekyll-optional-front-matter</code> and
          <code>jekyll-paginate</code> in addition to some optional ones like
          <code>jekyll-seo-tag</code> and <code>jekyll-sitemap</code>. You just
          configure them in your <code>_config.yml</code>. Pretty cool. If you
          are developing locally, you need to make sure that you install them
          using <code>gem install</code> in addition to adding them to your
          <code>_config.yml</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long story short, I have found GitHub pages and Jekyll to be a simple
          way to make and manage my site. Win!
        </p>
        <h3>iPadability</h3>
        <p>
          I recently got an iPad Pro. Since I got it, it's been a mission of
          mine to figure out how to do more dev work. I'll write more about what
          I've found in another post, but let's just say, the iPad won't be
          replacing my laptop anytime soon. Despite this, GitHub Pages fits
          really well into an iPad workflow. iPads obviously can't run any fancy
          command line tools, but luckily GitHub Pages builds the Jekyll page
          for you! So, using the fantastic
          <a
            href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8"
            class="external-link"
            >Working Copy</a
          >, I can keep a local version of my repo on my iPad. For code changes,
          I can make small changes (usually in
          <a
            href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor-6/id1049254261?mt=8"
            class="external-link"
            >Textastic</a
          >, push them, and boom—GitHub builds it for me and my changes are
          there. Yes, it's not as good as a feedback loop as running a local
          Jekyll server and making changes, but hey, its an iPad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing posts on the iPad is even better. Jekyll has some rules for a
          post to be valid: the file needs to be in the format
          <code>YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md</code> and the post needs valid
          frontmatter. I thought to myself, hey, that's something a computer
          should be able to do for me. Luckily
          <a
            href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8"
            class="external-link"
            >Workflow</a
          >
          on iOS has some pretty great automation tools. I was able to make a
          workflow that will take a markdown file, format it correctly for
          Jekyll, save it in Working Copy, commit it, and finally push it to
          GitHub. With a single tap, I can now do what would normally take
          several minutes and who knows how many taps. I don't know about you,
          but I think that's pretty cool. You can find it
          <a
            href="https://workflow.is/workflows/6094b228a4ae499b884634152cd3ab48"
            class="external-link"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it's much easier to manage on my iPad than having to SSH into my
          DigitalOcean droplet to update things. Still not perfect, but with the
          current state of iOS, it's not too shabby.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          There you have it—more than you'd ever want to know about me moving my
          blog to GitHub Pages! I recommend giving it a try sometime.

          For me, making
          <a href="https://appsto.re/us/8ebbjb.i" class="external-link"
            >Send To Nowhere</a
          >
          was a fun process. I like making things. Send To Nowhere was a dumb
          and simple enough idea to experiment with some things. I’ll try to
          write a little bit about why and how I made this app. The entire
          project is up on
          <a
            href="https://github.com/samwarnick/Send-To-Nowhere"
            class="external-link"
            >GitHub</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I had been reading a little bit about
            <a
              href="https://blog.zeplin.io/life-without-interface-builder-adbb009d2068"
              class="external-link"
              >making iOS apps without using any storyboards or the interface
              builder</a
            >. I liked this idea. I did a group project where we made an iOS
            app, and storyboards caused a bunch of problems when using git. Send
            To Nowhere seemed like a simple enough idea to try this out on.
          </li>
          <li>
            I also wanted to put an app on the App Store. I wanted to get more
            familiar with the whole ecosystem.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Life without the Interface Builder</h3>
        <p>
          Honestly, I didn’t miss the interface builder (IB) that much. The
          times I’ve used it, I feel like I was spending most of my time
          wrangling with constraints, and doing a lot of stuff that couldn’t be
          done in the IB programmatically anyways. This may be due to my
          inexperience with the IB. So, for me, it wasn’t a huge leap to doing
          everything programmatically. One of my CS classes had us doing a Java
          Swing interface without any IB, giving me a little experience using an
          UI framework programmatically. Needless to say, using Swift and UIKit
          is magnitudes better than using Java Swing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting started with doing everything programmatically was fairly
          easy. I just had to delete <code>Main.storyboard</code>, add a couple
          lines to <code>AppDelegate.swift</code>, and change one project
          setting. The following code shows the necessary changes to
          <code>AppDelegate.swift</code>. Basically, you have to grab the
          window, instantiate your own view controller, and set it as the root.

        <p>
          In the project settings, you have to make sure that the project is not
          looking for any storyboards. Make sure that this setting is blank so
          that the app will not try to load a storyboard that does not exist.
          The app will crash if you don’t.
        </p>
        <p>That was pretty much it to get going.</p>
        <p>
          Actually building the interface programmatically wasn’t too difficult
          either. There are many ways to do this, but for me, I had a
          <code>configureViews</code> function that was called in the
          <code>viewDidLoad</code> function of my view controllers. In there, I
          would create all of the UI elements and constrain them to be in the
          right place.

          The process was simple—make an UI element and add it as a subview.
          After that, you have to put it where you want using constraints. I
          used <a href="http://snapkit.io" class="external-link">SnapKit</a> for
          setting my constraints. It was pretty straightforward and it was easy
          enough to do everything I wanted. The only tricky thing was
          remembering to use negative numbers for the right and bottom
          constraints. For example, in the code above, I wanted the stack view
          to be 40 pts from the right edge of the view, so I had to give it an
          offset of -40.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was initially a little worried about doing segues programmatically,
          but again, I found it to be simple enough.
        </p>
        <pre
          class="language-swift"

</code></pre>
        <p>
          You create an instance of the view controller you want to go to, set
          it up as needed (in my case I was setting the modal presentation and
          transition styles), and call <code>present</code>. These were simple
          segues that would present the view on top of my main view. I would
          just call <code>dismiss</code> to get rid of it. This project didn’t
          get me into using any navigation controllers. That’s something I want
          to try in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          I liked doing everything programmatically. Even with the IB, I was
          spending so much time in the code, so it makes sense to me to do
          everything in the code. It takes the mystery out of everything. I
          learned a lot about the UI elements I was using because it required
          spending a lot more time in the documentation. I built this app on my
          own, so I didn’t get the advantages of avoiding merge conflicts and
          such, but I can imagine how it’d be a blessing. I’d recommend giving
          it a try and see if it fits how you work.
        </p>
        <h3>Submitting to the App store</h3>
        <p>
          I won’t get into the details of actually submitting to the App Store
          (there are plenty of good tutorials), but I’ll say that I did have
          some trouble because I started the project before I had a real
          developer account. It caused some weird issues with the bundle
          identifier. It just took some time to work out, but I got it in the
          end, obviously.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was about 80% sure my app would be rejected. One of the App Store’s
          criteria is:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            If your app doesn’t offer much functionality or content, or only
            applies to a small niche market, it may not be approved.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          So, I was worried that Send To Nowhere was too simple. It would have
          been fine if it had been rejected. I originally set out to just learn
          more about the whole process. But it was approved! After submitting,
          it took about a day and a half waiting to be reviewed and it took
          about 30 mins to be reviewed. It was very exciting. After that, it
          took about 6 hours to propagate to the App Store.
        </p>
        <p>
          To date (about 6 days after it’s been released), Send To Nowhere has
          been downloaded an entire 18 times!
        </p>
        <h3>The Future</h3>
        <p>
          Luckily, Send To Nowhere is simple enough that bugs shouldn’t come up.
          I had a few people beta test it to get the kinks out. But we’ll see if
          anything pops up. It’s always possible. I have a few ideas for
          possible updates. So there will most likely be version 1.1. After
          that, who knows!

          I just found out, I think two days ago, that CSS has native
          &quot;variables&quot;. I discovered this while looking through some
          generated code from
          <a href="https://zeplin.io/" class="external-link">Zeplin</a>. CSS
          preprocessors like LESS and Sass give us this ability, and probably do
          it pretty well. I don’t really know. I haven’t used them much. For
          whatever reasons, I like writing plain CSS. So, without further ado,
          here’s an example of CSS variables:
        </p>
        <pre
          class="language-css"
        ><code class="language-css"><span class="token selector">:root</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token property">--lightblue</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> #65def1<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token selector">.nav-link</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token property">font-size</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 20px<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token property">color</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> #65def1<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token property">color</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token function">var</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>--lighblue<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Apparently this has been around since 2014-ish, as far as I can tell.
          <code>:root</code> is a pseudo-class which, in most contexts,
          represents the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. More on :root can be
          found
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root"
            class="external-link"
            >here</a
          >. As you can see in the snippet, the variable starts with
          <code>--</code>. This sets it apart as a
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*"
            class="external-link"
            >custom property</a
          >. Custom properties can be used as variables using
          <code>var()</code>! How cool. Because the custom properties are
          defined in <code>:root</code>, they are global. There’s all sorts of
          inheritance things with that, for better or worse. <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables#Browser_compatibility"
            class="external-link"
            >Browser support</a
          >
          is pretty good, with one notable exception (I’m looking at you IE…🙄).
          That’s why line 7 exists in the snippet. It defines the color just
          incase someone has no idea what to do with <code>var()</code>. Seems
          kinda redundant, but it’s not the end of the world. Just a minor/mild
          nuisance. It’s not CSS’s fault though. Maybe Edge supports it? I don’t
          know. Maybe no one will use IE again? Hopefully. I need to do more
          browser testing with it myself. Maybe there’s a gulp and/or webpack
          tool that can automatically insert that fallback line for you. I
          should look into that.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that’s a brief overview of CSS variables. I think it’s pretty cool
          because it lessens our dependency on preprocessors and such. The end.
