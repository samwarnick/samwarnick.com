          Here are a few numbers related to making Focuses that may or may not
          be interesting.
        </p>
        <h3>130 hours</h3>
        <p>
          This is the first project I have time tracked. The first commit for
          Focuses was on December 13, 2019. About 13 weeks later I submitted it
          for review. So that's about 10 hours a week. Some weeks were much less
          and some were much more. This also doesn't include times when I was
          thinking about the app when I couldn't sleep or showering and stuff
          like that. A lot of the work on Focuses was done early in the morning
          before I started work for my full-time job. 130 hours seems like a lot
          to me, but it's about 3 weeks of full time work.
        </p>
        <h3>147 tasks complete</h3>
        <p>
          I'm using Things to keep track of everything I'm working on for this
          app. This probably isn't <em>that</em> useful of a number since my
          tasks ranged from &quot;iPad&quot; to &quot;Fix accent color on focus
          edit sheet&quot;. But 147 sounds kind of impressive.
        </p>
        <h3>183 commits</h3>
        <p>
          A commit is every time I make a change to the code and save it to
          version control. Only about a dozen of these were of the
          &quot;Uncomment code I commented out&quot; variety. My build number is
          based on the number of commits on the master branch. Again, this
          number doesn't mean a whole lot because some commits were changing a
          single color and some were adding multiple views and data models at
          the same time.
        </p>
        <h3>19 minutes spent in &quot;In Review&quot;</h3>
        <p>
          This surprised me. I submitted it for review about 7 am on March 9.
          About 6 hours later it moved from &quot;Waiting for Review&quot; to
          &quot;In Review&quot;. Then about 19 minutes later it moved into
          &quot;Pending Developer Release&quot;.
        </p>

        <p>
          Focuses is my take on goal and habit tracking. It is inspired by Myke
          Hurley's daily themes and Marshall Goldsmith's daily active questions.
          The idea is to have a simple and flexible system for scoring yourself
          on how you do towards your goals each day. There are 3 options, an
          empty circle, and half-filled circle, and a filled circle. What these
          mean is up to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          When SwiftUI was announced at WWDC 2019, I began thinking of projects
          I could try it out on. An idea for a daily questions app kept coming
          back to me. It would be an app that asked you the questions you wanted
          each day. Stuff like &quot;How did you do towards eating healthy
          today?&quot; You would respond with some like &quot;Bad&quot; or
          &quot;Good&quot;. I started a version of this app, but abandoned it. I
          didn't like that approach. It felt too constrained.
        </p>
        <p>
          While listening to
          <a href="https://relay.fm/cortex" class="external-link">Cortex</a>, I
          heard Myke talking about his system of rating himself on a scale of 0,
          1, or 2. Those scores would add up to a daily score. I really liked
          that approach. It felt flexible and easy to track. I tried it on
          paper, but it didn't stick. So with the New Year fast approaching, I
          thought why not try to make a simple app to do it for me? I'm a novice
          iOS developer at best, so what I thought would be simple was not so
          simple for me. But after about 3 months of slow and steady work, I'm
          excited to release the first version of Focuses!
        </p>
        <p>
          I made the app for myself. I use it everyday. Tracking my effort
          towards my goals has had a tangible effect on my life. It's helped me
          and I hope it can help others.
        </p>

        <p>
          For about the last year and a half, my daughter and I have made a
          podcast. My daughter is currently a toddler. It's not always easy to
          produce a podcast with a toddler, but I have found the end product to
          be priceless.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Because every child is different, this is
          going to be less of a how to and more of a &quot;my experience with
          podcasting with a toddler.&quot;
        </p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          Toddler's are not always the easiest to work with. So why would I
          bring it upon myself to try to make a podcast with one?
        </p>
        <p>
          Like many of my cohorts in the millennial generation, I’m really into
          podcasts. Like many podcasts listeners, I’ve thought “I should make a
          podcast.” <em>Should</em> might be a stretch. But I definitely
          <em>could</em> record audio and post it on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          A couple buddies and I tried starting a podcast called
          <a href="https://averageofaverages.com" class="external-link"
            >Average of Averages</a
          >. Being the tech nerd I am, I loved doing all the technical stuff of
          a podcast—recording, making a website, generating a feed, etc.—but I
          had trouble figuring out what could make out show different and
          engaging. Three white guys talking about nothing? How original. We
          never did figure out our niche. Finding time for three people to
          record also wasn’t easy. It fizzled out after two episodes.
        </p>
        <p>I still wanted to make a podcast though.</p>
        <p>
          Around this time, my daughter started putting multiple words together
          in cute little 18-month old sentences. I’m terrible at writing a
          journal. I’m also terrified that I’ll forget all the adorable things
          my daughter says. Then it hit me! Here’s a tiny human being, in my own
          house, whose schedule I have small amount of control over (more on
          this later), <em>and</em> I want some way to record her so I can
          remember how cute and little she was. There’s the podcast.
          <a href="https://lilyandsam.show" class="external-link"
            >The Lily &amp; Sam Show</a
          >
          was born.
        </p>
        <h3>Making the Podcast</h3>
        <p>
          After about a year and a half and a couple dozen episodes, I feel like
          we're finally at a place where recording and editing is a smooth
          process. It's taken a lot of trial and error to get to this point
          though.
        </p>
        <h4>Starting with One Microphone</h4>
        <p>
          We started recording with a single microphone, the
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QJOZS4/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_LvyEDb06RZWGX"
            class="external-link"
            >Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB</a
          >. I chose this microphone because it was recommended both by
          <a
            href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/11/a-podcast-studio-for-under-100/"
            class="external-link"
            >Jason Snell</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://marco.org/podcasting-microphones"
            class="external-link"
            >Marco Arment</a
          >
          (#4 on Marco's mega review). It’s a great USB mic. My daughter would
          sit in my lap and I’d move the mic up and down depending on who was
          talking. I quickly realized this was not going to be a great long term
          solution. She kept wanting to turn around and look at me and moving
          the mic between us often missed what she or I would say. Not great.
        </p>
        <h4>Upgrading to Two Microphones</h4>
        <p>
          I later purchased a second mic, the
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GEBGA0/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_vAyEDb4D095HJ"
            class="external-link"
            >Pyle PDMIC58</a
          >, a cheap XLR mic also recommended by Marco Arment (#5 on Marco's
          mega review). Since this was XLR only, I needed an USB audio
          interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was able to borrow a
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GEBGA0/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_vAyEDb4D095HJ"
            class="external-link"
            >Zoom H6</a
          >
          from a coworker. I was considering buying one because it would double
          as a recorder and an interface. I thought we might have an easier time
          recording if I could follow her around and record her in a less
          controlled environment. My microphones weren’t suited for that at all.
          So we tried the Zoom H6 as an audio interface. Turns out she loved
          having her own chair and microphone.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I knew that was the direction we needed to head. My wife bought
          surprised me with a
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QHURLHM/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_pCyEDbK0FVNH2"
            class="external-link"
            >Behringer UMC404HD</a
          >
          audio interface after I had to return the Zoom H6 to my friend. The
          Behringer was the most affordable decent audio interface that had more
          than 2 XLR inputs I could find. (I wanted to be able to have at least
          3 inputs because my wife occasionally joins us on the podcast.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t know if you know this about toddlers or not, but they don’t
          stop moving. The problem with my daughter sitting in her own chair and
          having her own microphone, is she kept moving and touching the mic!
          So. Much. Noise. My daughter also liked switching seats with me for a
          while. That made editing a pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also got a couple heavy mic stands to set on my desk (<a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BPELU68/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_IbzEDbF9KXAZW"
            class="external-link"
            >these ones</a
          >). This lets us sit on opposite ends of the desk and face each other.
          In addition to being able to put the mics in the right place for both
          of us, this reduces the amount of noise bleed there is.
        </p>
        <h4>Editing</h4>
        <p>
          I edit in GarageBand. I don't love it, but it's free! I've gotten
          faster at editing over the months, but it's still a chore.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you've listened to any of our episodes you know they are short,
          like 2–3 minutes. In order to get 2–3 of content, we now typically
          record for about 10+ minutes. At the beginning it sometimes took 20+
          minutes to get 2 minutes of material. Most editing is cutting out the
          parts where it's quiet, she's running off to play with her LEGOs, or
          she is being too grumpy. Occasionally I move stuff around to make the
          conversation more coherent. It used to take me about an hour to cut 17
          minutes of recordings down to 2 minutes. Now I can edit an episode in
          about 20 minutes. With 2 mics you get 2 tracks, which makes it easier
          to see who's talking where and what can be cut out. I always listen
          through once or twice with my eyes closed to make sure it all sounds
          decently coherent.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried so hard at the beginning to remove all of my daughter's mic
          bumps and the noise of her moving in her chair. Eventually I kinda
          gave up on that mission. I began to see it as the charm of recording
          with a podcast; hearing how lively she is while we record. I
          personally think it gives the podcast a bit of character.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the hardest parts of editing has been adjusting levels. Because
          my daughter moves around so much, sometimes she's too quiet and
          sometimes she's too loud. So I have to go through and a bunch of
          volume automation points all over to help it sound a bit better.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="/posts/podcasting-with-a-toddler/garageband_levels.png"
            alt="Screenshot of audio levels in GarageBand"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          As she has gotten older and her language skills have improved, the
          editing process as gotten easier and easier. So the future is bright.
        </p>
        <h3>The Website</h3>
        <p>
          I will write more about the technical aspects of the website in
          another post, but
          <a href="https://lilyandsam.show" class="external-link"
            >lilyandsam.show</a
          >
          pulls in data from my custom CMS at
          <a href="https://verygood.fm" class="external-link">verygood.fm</a>
          and generates the RSS feed. It's built with NuxtJS and is hosted on
          Netlify. Netlify made it simple to add a form for people to ask
          questions for the show. Those questions are emailed to me.
        </p>
        <h3>The Future</h3>
        <p>
          We're now recording the podcast about every other week, sometimes once
          a month. I love having these recordings. I love when my daughter runs
          up to me and asks if we can record the podcast. I love seeing her grin
          when she listens back to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes it's real tough to make. My daughter gets grumpy and hungry
          and doesn't want to record. Or she'll say she wants to record just get
          into my office and play. But on average, I'd say it's worth it.
        </p>
        <p>I'll keep making it as long as she wants to.</p>
        <h3>A Message From My Daughter</h3>
        <p>
          My daughter wanted to help me type this. So the following is typed by
          her:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>/.l  l., ÷¬;l¬…÷ln,no.,,;/,jllj</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>,g.,/on/j</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Thanks for reading!</p>

        <p>
          I've been working full-time as a software developer for almost 2 years
          now. I’ve learned a lot. I’ve messed a bunch of stuff up too. The
          question I’ve been struggling with is
          <strong
            >how do I know I’m <em>actually</em> becoming a better
            developer?</strong
          >
          Over the last couple of years, I feel like I'm becoming a better
          developer. But is feeling better enough?
        </p>
        <h3>What makes a good developer, IMO?</h3>
        <p>
          I haven't worked with or known a <em>ton</em> of developers, but I've
          worked with some great ones. Besides the actual code a developer
          produces, there is lots that makes a developer great. There is lots
          that make a developer great, but here are a few things that I think
          make a developer (and people in general) great:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            They are approachable. They always have time to help the junior dev
            like me and give helpful feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            They know how to find answers. Because of this, they seem to have a
            super-human ability to know everything.
          </li>
          <li>
            They volunteer to work on the hard stuff. This leads to them
            learning more because they stretch themselves.
          </li>
          <li>They admit when they don't know something.</li>
          <li>They are not afraid to admit they were wrong.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, all these things are hard to measure. I think most
          people can agree that the easy things to measure (number of lines
          written, number of tickets closed, etc.) have little bearing on
          whether a developer is great. So that's where I get stuck. I want to
          get better, I know what I think a good developer looks like, but how
          do I know I am better than I was a week, a month, a year ago?
        </p>
        <h3>Can getting better be measured?</h3>
        <p>
          I like numbers. They are easy to compare. But how do I compare
          something like being approachable? I could maybe find a number to
          represent it, like number of questions I get a day. I could ask people
          to give me a rating on how approachable they think I am, but I'm
          guessing the people who like me would rate me highly and the people
          who don't would rate me poorly, and that it wouldn't change much over
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's assume I do find a number or a couple numbers to represent
          approachability. Over time, I think I would subconsciously, or maybe
          even consciously, find a way to game that number. I'd want to chase
          that good feeling that comes from seeing a number improve. My point
          is, numbers probably won't work very well. Are all metrics bad? No.
          Are most? Maybe. It's hard to find the useful metrics. But they do
          exist, I think. But I also know from personal experience that it is
          incredibly easy to focus too much on the number and not on the end
          result the number is supposed to measure.
        </p>
        <h3>So, is feeling better enough?</h3>
        <p>
          I'm now thinking yes, just feeling like you're a better developer is
          probably enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hosts of one of my favorite podcasts,
          <a href="https://relay.fm/cortex" class="external-link">Cortex</a>,
          talk about yearly themes. Instead of making yearly goals or
          resolutions, they have a theme. Whenever a decision or opportunity
          comes up, you can just look at your theme determine if the decision is
          on or off theme. I think a similar tactic can be taken with becoming a
          better developer. Instead of creating specific goals or measuring
          (pointless) metrics, just keep what you think makes a developer great
          in mind, and when situations arise, just ask, &quot;How would a great
          developer act in this situation?&quot;. Sounds cheesy, I know. But
          that's the best I can come up with right now. It's not just wanting to
          be a better developer that makes someone better. It is knowing what
          you want to be like and acting more and more like that until you
          become that.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any ideas or thoughts, let me know. I’d appreciate it.
          This is all still forming in my mind. What do you think makes a
          developer great? How do you know that you're getting better?
        </p>

          used it on this site like the following:
        </p>
        <pre
          class="language-css"
        ><code class="language-css"><span class="token atrule"><span class="token rule">@media</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token property">prefers-color-scheme</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> dark<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

            >WebKit release notes</a

          <code>light</code> at the moment. I tested both, and the do appear to
          work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, kind of cool! I'm sure my dark mode looks bad, so I'll work
          on it. But I hope other browsers implement this media query soon as
          well.
        </p>
        <h3>Update 24 Jan 2019</h3>
        <p>
          Here is a Tailwind CSS plugin to add a dark and light variants. Just
          add this to the <code>plugins</code> array in your Tailwind config
          file.
