        <p>
          Using my phone less has been on my mind for quite a while now. For no
          good reason, I’m 100% addicted to Twitter. I always have my phone on
          me, just in case there’s a text I need to reply to immediately, or
          some fact needs to be Googled, or to waste time when I'm bored. I
          enjoyed <em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport, so I thought I would give
          <em>Digital Minimalism</em> a shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          My summary is this: make it easier for yourself to make deliberate
          choices about how and when to use your phone and other technology. So
          much of my current phone use is just a reflex, and I want to change
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t think there is anything revolutionary in this book. But it was
          full of good, timeless advice and ideas, sort of like talking to your
          friend who listens to a lot of podcasts. It made me think and reflect.
          Who knew books could do that.
        </p>
        <h3>My Digital Minimalism Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          I didn’t feel like going through the 30 day purge like Newport
          suggests. But I took some time to evaluate what I could do anyway.
          Here’s what I came up with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I deleted Twitter, Reddit, and Hulu from my phone. These are my
            biggest time-wasters. I also blocked Twitter through Screen Time on
            iOS. I still have these on my iPad so that I can use them when I
            make a deliberate decision to.
          </li>
          <li>
            I only watch whatever I’m binging at the moment while I’m riding the
            exercise bike.
          </li>
          <li>
            I removed high volume RSS feeds like The Verge. Now I don’t feel the
            need to open my RSS reader often to check the latest news.
          </li>
          <li>
            I cut down the number of podcasts I’m subscribed to—admittedly, I
            have more work to do here since I’m still subscribed to 25…
          </li>
          <li>
            When I move into my new house, I would like to have a local
            newspaper delivered.
          </li>
          <li>
            Switch to the iPhone 12 Mini. I was planning on upgrading to the
            Max, but I thought that maybe having a smaller screen would make me
            less likely to use my phone for things like watching videos and
            reading. I’m not certain this is <em>actually</em> the case, but I
            do love the size of the Mini.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I’m also experimenting with a pocket notebook. So far I’ve been using
          it to plan my weeks and sometimes days. I also use it to record ideas
          and other thoughts. I’m still figuring out how exactly I want to use
          this, but it has already reduced my dependence on my phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two main things that cause me to pickup my phone
          often—podcasts and time tracking. I suppose I could use the Toggl
          website instead of using
          <a href="https://timeryapp.com" class="external-link">Timery</a>, but
          the Timery widget just makes it so easy. I've also experimented with
          listening to podcasts on my Apple Watch. I actually like using my
          watch quite a bit—I don’t need to pick up my phone when I go somewhere
          else in the house. But it is not always reliable. The podcast I want
          to listen to is not always on my watch when I want to listen, so I
          often still use my phone. I use
          <a href="https://overcast.fm" class="external-link">Overcast</a
          >—because of it’s superior Smart Speed® and Voice Boost®—but maybe I
          should look into other options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, I feel like all this is making a difference. I don’t feel the
          need to always have my phone on me. I feel more engaged when I’m just
          hanging out with the family. Overall, I’m on board with the idea of
          using your phone less. I’ll take another look in a couple months and
          see what I need to adjust and tweak, maybe to do the whole 30 day
          purge that he suggests. Perhaps, Phase 2 will be when I switch to a
          rotary landline for all communication—buttons would make it too easy
          to call people.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like routines and planning. Routines is one of my ways of managing
          anxiety and stress. I like to feel like I know what’s going on and
          what’s coming up. But I have a 4 year-old. So I have to be somewhat
          flexible, and I’m always tinkering with my routines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last year and a half or so, I’ve been able to take advantage
          of my mornings more. Minus getting-ready-in-the-morning-time, I
          typically have between an hour and an hour and a half to myself while
          no one else is awake. I have loved this time. It’s when I’ve worked on
          my app
          <a
            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focuses/id1492385864#?platform=iphone"
            class="external-link"
            >Focuses</a
          >
          and other side projects. Sometimes I take that time to read in the
          mornings or play a game. It’s when I’m writing this. It’s just some
          great quiet time that I get all to myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not naturally a morning person. I’m more productive in the
          evenings. But mornings still work better for me. I work full-time and
          I also do some part-time contract work. After a full day of work, I’m
          dead and don’t feel like doing anything besides relaxing with my
          family. It never seems to work out well the occasional times that I
          trick myself into playing with a side project in the evening. I’m
          pretty obsessive, so often, programming gets my mind whirring and I
          can’t sleep, so I stay up far too late working on something. With a
          child in the house who consistently wakes up early, and my needing 8
          hours of sleep to feel barely functional, staying up late is not a
          great option.
        </p>
        <p>So that’s why I’ve landed on mornings. And it was great.</p>
        <p>Wait, was?</p>
        <p>
          Yup. Was. Well, maybe I'm being a <em>little</em> premature. My wife
          and I are expecting another baby in a couple months. We are, of
          course, incredibly excited, and it brings a smile to my face just to
          write it. But a new baby is going to change everything. If this baby
          is anything like our first, I won’t consistently have my mornings
          again for about 2 years. But that’s fine. Sure, I’m going to miss the
          regularity of have the mornings to myself, but sharing early mornings
          with a baby is much better.
        </p>
        <p>
          I won’t get as much side-project type stuff done. That’s a given. And
          I’ll have to give up my oh-so-comforting routines in favor of the
          beckoning cry of a newborn. It will be a fun puzzle each day fitting
          in the baby’s needs and my wants.
        </p>
        <p>
          So thanks, mornings. You’ve been great. And we still have a couple
          months, so let’s get some updates to Focuses out or something while we
          can.
        </p>

        <p>Overall, I liked this book. I give it a thumbs up 👍🏻.</p>
        <p>
          I can't remember when I really became aware of Steve Jobs. I was aware
          of Apple growing up, and was envious of friends who had iPod Minis in
          iPod Socks. But Steve Jobs was never really on my radar. I didn't grow
          up idolizing him. Years later, I have learned more about him and grown
          to respect him and the company he built. Reading
          <em>Steve Jobs</em> gave me a much better understanding of who he was.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a software developer. I write code. Some days, I like to pretend
          that I'm a designer too. I value well thought out details in the
          products I use and strive to put the same care into detail into what I
          build. I wish I had the time a resources available to get things just
          right every time, but that's just not realistic. The whole point of
          design is working within constraints. And eventually you have to ship.
        </p>
        <p>
          One story that really resonated with me was how distraught Jobs was
          when he discovered the CD drive in the new iMac was a tray and not a
          slot. So close to release, there was nothing to be done expect to
          delay the release. Those around him convinced him that it wasn't worth
          delaying the release over. My wife and I are building a house right
          now. It seems like every day the builders do something that in my mind
          is incorrect, but it is too late or too expensive to change. It drives
          me crazy, and I know years from now I'll look back and think &quot;I
          could've gotten this right.&quot; But ultimately, I would rather have
          a finished house than a perpetually incomplete house that will never
          meet my standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          I doubt anyone else could've done what Steve Jobs did. But, of course,
          he didn't do it alone. He surrounded himself with people who could
          execute his vision. No one gets everything right the first time every
          time, not even Jobs. Hopefully we get a chance to try again and
          improve.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had to cut myself off on adding new features to Focuses pretty early
          on. If I let myself keep going, I probably never would've released.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a few things on my roadmap that I would like to work on.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Better iPad support. This might be my biggest priority. Current iPad
            support is basic at best. I wanted to launch with multiple device
            support using CloudKit. I had never used CloudKit before, so I'm
            glad I went ahead, because I quickly found I did things wrong. A lot
            of people's data would not have synced if I added it later. Anyway,
            my focus was on getting Focuses onto iPad, not making a good iPad
            app. There's a lot about making good iPad apps that I just don't
            know, so I'm excited to learn.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data import/export. I think it would be nice to be able to export
            all the data as a CSV or something. Importing will be a little
            tricky because I will have to think about how to handle existing
            data. I could always start with just export.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shortcuts support. There's a few shortcuts that I think might be
            useful.
          </li>
          <li>
            Watch app. I've never built a watch app before, so that would be
            kind of fun.
          </li>
          <li>
            Graphs and trends. Some beta testers said that having graphs might
            be nice. While I think the calendar view does a pretty good job, I'm
            going to explore this. Perhaps a way to view week by week or month
            by month instead of day by day. Or a way to see at a glance if
            you're doing better or worse on a particular focus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Widget. I've also never made a widget, so again, lots to figure out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Smarter and richer notifications. Right now, notifications are
            pretty basic, once a day at the same time, regardless of if you've
            entered scores or not. There's a lot of opportunity here to do more.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There's more on my list, but these are probably the biggest. If you
          have any ideas, or your favorite feature is missing, let me know on
          <a href="https://twitter.com/samwarnick" class="external-link"

        <p>
          I think I mentioned it briefly, but Focuses is built mostly with
          SwiftUI. Overall, I'm very impressed with SwiftUI. I don't think I
          would've been able to build the first version of Focuses as quickly as
          I did had I not used SwiftUI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focuses is my first &quot;real&quot; iOS app. My first app,
          <a
            href="https://samwarnick.com/projects/send-to-nowhere"
            class="external-link"
            >Send To Nowhere</a
          >, is a simple app using UIKit, Swift, and no storyboard. I'm still a
          novice when it comes to the iOS ecosystem. I'm a full-time web
          developer by day, so using SwiftUI felt familiar in ways. However, the
          declarative nature of it still feels quite foreign from time to time.
        </p>
        <h3>SwiftUI: The Good</h3>
        <p>
          I was worried that SwiftUI wasn't going to be mature enough to
          complete my app. I was surprised at how capable it currently
          is—despite it's many shortcomings—and I'm very excited to see it
          develop. It's not perfect, but I was able to use it for about 95% of
          my views. Even in the short time I have been building Focuses, I've
          seen great bug fixes and improvements come to SwiftUI. I'm very
          optimistic for it's future.
        </p>
        <p>
          SwiftUI made some things in Focuses a breeze to implement. Take the
          animation when filling up the circle. That whole view, including the
          animation, took me about 10 minutes to make. Again, I'm not a UIKit
          expert, but I have no idea where to start if I had to make that same
          view without using SwiftUI.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/verygoodfm/video/upload/c_fill,g_north,h_500,w_500,e_loop/v1584789978/samwarnick.com/score_indicator.gif"
            alt="Animation of score indicator filling up"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating complex layouts like the calendar was relatively straight
          forward as well. I think my first implementation had too many nested
          views, which were being rendered too often, so it took a long time to
          load. But it was easy to go from idea to implementation quickly. I was
          able to iterate and make a much more performant version fairly
          quickly.
        </p>
        <p>

            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/verygoodfm/image/upload/v1584789837/samwarnick.com/calendar.png"
            alt="Sreenshot of Focuses calendar with boxes around elements"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like how easy it is to use CoreData with SwiftUI. There were
          times that things weren't updating when I thought they should've, but
          I found ways around it. This was my first time using CoreData, so for
          all I know, I could be doing everything wrong and that's the source of
          my problems. Hopefully not though.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main issue with CoreData and SwiftUI, in my opinion, is previews.
          I could not find a way to adequately seed that database for previews.
          So for much of the project, I did not use previews. Maybe I need to
          take another look at this.
        </p>
        <h3>SwiftUI: The Bad</h3>
        <p>
          SwiftUI is great at hiding complexity and implementation details, like
          when using <code>@FetchRequest</code>. However, once you want to do
          something that is more complex, like pass in params to your fetch
          request, things can get messy.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a couple things I needed to use UIKit for:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Text fields that I wanted to become the first responder (i.e.,
            receive focus when the view appears and show the keyboard).
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>UITextView</code>. There doesn't appear to be a SwiftUI
            equivalent of this. I needed a multi-line text input for notes. I
            also wanted an input accessory view, and I believe this can still
            only be done using UIKit.
          </li>
          <li>
            I wanted to set the scroll position of the calendar view so you
            would start at the bottom. The only way I could find to do this is
            by using a <code>UITableView</code>. I was still able to use my
            SwiftUI view for the cells.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There's also some things that just don't make a lot of sense. Action
          sheets do not work on iPad. You have to use a
          <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56910941/present-actionsheet-in-swiftui-on-ipad"
            class="external-link"
            >work around</a
          >. iPad support in general seems kinda weak. I’ve found it tough to
          make layouts for iPad, part of the reason the first version of Focuses
          doesn’t have great iPad support. I need to spend more time figuring it
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also had a lot of trouble embedding forms <em>inside</em> other
          views, like on the privacy and about views. My solution is hacky and
          doesn't respond well to changing the system font size, but it works
          for now. Essentially, I have to give the form a set height based on my
          best guess using the font size. Additionally, I have to use
          <code>.fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)</code> on all the
          text so it would wrap properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also wish there was a way to customize the navigation bar. As far as
          I can tell, you're stuck with it's color and font.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping all these things will be addressed in iOS 14, or possibly
          even point updates of iOS 13.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          The best resource I've found for SwiftUI is
          <a
            href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui"
            class="external-link"
            >Hacking with Swift</a
          >. The examples are fantastic.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I were starting a new app today, I think I would still start with
          SwiftUI. I feel like I'm faster when I use it, and it's pretty simple
          to use a UIKit view if you need to. I think I've only scratched the
          surface of what SwiftUI is capable of. I need to delve deeper into
          animations and transitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm excited for the future of SwiftUI. I feel like it allows me to
          create things I would've dreaded to try a year ago.
        </p>
