          I get distracted. Easily. I'm the kind of person that gets a message
          and somehow ends up reading about the KGB stealing plans for the space
          shuttle to build Buran in between the time of looking at the
          notification and the phone unlocking.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first attempt at focusing more and being less distracted was to
          just have less stuff. My dream was to be able to use an iPad for
          everything. In college, I tried using my iPad Mini for notes,
          textbooks, and other reading. Later, when I got the iPad Pro
          10.5&quot;, I tried using it for drawing, reading, writing, gaming,
          and even programming. It was more successful at all these than the
          Mini, but with programming being my job and my hobby, it wasn't a
          great experience overall.<sup class="footnote-ref"
            ><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup
          >
          I <em>really</em> wanted to be an iPad guy, and it took me a long time
          to figure out that it's not for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My life changed (when <em>doesn't</em> your life change?) when my wife
          got me a Kindle for my birthday. The Kindle is for reading books and
          that's pretty much it.

        <p>
          <em>Steal Like an Artist</em> by Austin Klein was able to clearly
          articulate a lot of ideas that I have not been able to fully form
          myself. I have long believed that there really isn't any idea that has
          not been had before. Nothing is original. By stealing from one
          another<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup
          >, we learn. If we steal many good things from a variety of people, we
          are able to combine them into something worthy of being stolen by
          someone else; We create our own voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The part I had not fully come to grips with is if nothing is original,
          what's the point? Klein included a quote from Andr√© Gide:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Everything that needs to be said has already been said.
            <strong
              >But, since no one was listening, everything must be said
              again.</strong
            >
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I love this perspective. As the father of a four year-old, this hit
          close to home. So, what's the point? There is someone who has not
          heard what you have to say. If they are going to hear it, why not let
          it be from you? I probably knew this already, but I couldn't
          articulate it before reading this book.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I agree with most things in the book, I had a major disagreement
          with one point he makes. While talking about how we are able to learn
          by surrounding ourselves with people more talent, he said &quot;if you
          ever find that you're the most talented person in the room, you need
          to find another room.&quot; While I get what he's getting at, it's too
          selfish of an attitude for me. A better question than which room can I
          move to, is how can help those in <em>this</em> room become more
          talented. I think a lot can be gained from changing your perspective
          from &quot;what can I take?&quot; to &quot;what can I give?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll end with my favorite quote included in the book from Jessica
          Hische, a very talented designer:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you
            should be doing for the rest of your life.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Steal Like an Artist</em> is a quick, worthwhile read. I give it a
          thumbs up. Thanks for reading, and as Klein recommends, I'm going to
          go and enjoy and use my obscurity.

          Like I said in
          <a
            href="/posts/wrapping-up-the-year-of-groundwork"
            class="internal-link"
            >Wrapping Up the Year of Groundwork</a
          >, after 2020, I don't feel like I have much gas left in the tank.
          That's why I've decided to make 2021 the Year of Momentum. I want to
          keep going on the good things I started in 2020. I'm still figuring
          out what that means exactly, but here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm currently at:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My wife and I are trying to finish our house in the next few weeks.
            We have been living with my in-laws for over a year now. Much longer
            than planned.
          </li>
          <li>
            A few weeks after we‚Äôre planning on moving into our house, we are
            expecting a new baby.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In short, it‚Äôs going to take a lot for me to barely make it through
          this winter, hence the Season of Survival. The next few months are
          going to be about managing stress and anxiety. So unless I think it
          will be helpful, I‚Äôm not going to start anything new.
          <a
            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focuses/id1492385864#?platform=iphone"
            class="external-link"
            >Focuses</a
          >
          will probably be on the back burner until Spring (though there are a
          couple bug fixes I should probably get out soon ü§î.) I might even need
          to pull back on the amount of time I‚Äôve been freelancing. There's a
          lot that needs to be done, and I need to figure out how to get it all
          done without collapsing on myself like a dying star.
        </p>
        <p>So 2021, keep going and try not to crash.</p>

        <p>
          2020 has been a hard year for everyone. But I have been very
          fortunate. I was already working from home, my company does well in
          good and bad economic times, my D&amp;D group was online already, and
          my daughter is not in school yet. So I know I have had it a whole lot
          easier than most people. In all honesty, I feel like 2020 has been one
          of my better years. If it wasn‚Äôt for the stress of building a house
          during a pandemic and living with my in-laws, I would feel pretty
          great right now. Not having to go to places like church or work events
          has reduced my base-level of anxiety quite a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          My theme for 20202 was the year of groundwork. I wanted to do things
          that would help me open doors in the future. A couple things I had in
          mind were release an iOS app and start freelancing a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I did well in both of those areas. Though, at times I did feel
          like I was overextending myself at times.
        </p>
        <h3>Freelancing</h3>
        <p>
          My plan had been to release Focuses and then start doing some
          freelance work. Focuses took more of my energy than I was expecting.
          But in the late Summer, I set up an LLC as a first step. Right after I
          did that, a former coworker called me up and asked if I was interested
          in taking over some side-work of his. I was very lucky.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Started some ongoing freelance work in September.</li>
          <li>
            Have made enough money to do things like max out my HSA to help pay
            for a new baby next year.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Focuses</h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focuses/id1492385864#?platform=iphone"
            class="external-link"
            >Focuses</a
          >
          is probably my biggest personal success of 2020. It made me stretch
          and I learned a lot doing it. I'm proud of it. I feel like it was
          worth the effort I put into it, which was a lot‚Äînearly 200 hours in
          2020.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Released in March 2020.</li>
          <li>
            Released 11 additional updates throughout the year. Only a couple
            were to fix pretty egregious oversights of a previous release üòÉ.
          </li>
          <li>
            It made some money. Not much at all, but enough to pay for my
            developer account and domain name.
          </li>
          <li>It was written about on a couple websites.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition to freelancing and Focuses, I also did a decent job of
          waking up early to work on side-projects, I read a lot of books (for
          me), and I exercised a few times a week. So in 2021, I‚Äôd like to keep
          going on the good habits I developed during 2020. But honestly, I
          don‚Äôt feel like I have much gas left in the tank. I need to be careful
          in 2021 to not completely burn myself out.
