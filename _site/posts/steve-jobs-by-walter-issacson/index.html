        <p>Overall, I liked this book. I give it a thumbs up üëçüèª.</p>
        <p>
          I can't remember when I really became aware of Steve Jobs. I was aware
          of Apple growing up, and was envious of friends who had iPod Minis in
          iPod Socks. But Steve Jobs was never really on my radar. I didn't grow
          up idolizing him. Years later, I have learned more about him and grown
          to respect him and the company he built. Reading
          <em>Steve Jobs</em> gave me a much better understanding of who he was.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a software developer. I write code. Some days, I like to pretend
          that I'm a designer too. I value well thought out details in the
          products I use and strive to put the same care into detail into what I
          build. I wish I had the time a resources available to get things just
          right every time, but that's just not realistic. The whole point of
          design is working within constraints. And eventually you have to ship.
        </p>
        <p>
          One story that really resonated with me was how distraught Jobs was
          when he discovered the CD drive in the new iMac was a tray and not a
          slot. So close to release, there was nothing to be done expect to
          delay the release. Those around him convinced him that it wasn't worth
          delaying the release over. My wife and I are building a house right
          now. It seems like every day the builders do something that in my mind
          is incorrect, but it is too late or too expensive to change. It drives
          me crazy, and I know years from now I'll look back and think &quot;I
          could've gotten this right.&quot; But ultimately, I would rather have
          a finished house than a perpetually incomplete house that will never
          meet my standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          I doubt anyone else could've done what Steve Jobs did. But, of course,
          he didn't do it alone. He surrounded himself with people who could
          execute his vision. No one gets everything right the first time every
          time, not even Jobs. Hopefully we get a chance to try again and
          improve.
        </p>
