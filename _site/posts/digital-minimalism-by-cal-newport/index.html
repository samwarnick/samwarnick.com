        <p>
          Using my phone less has been on my mind for quite a while now. For no
          good reason, I’m 100% addicted to Twitter. I always have my phone on
          me, just in case there’s a text I need to reply to immediately, or
          some fact needs to be Googled, or to waste time when I'm bored. I
          enjoyed <em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport, so I thought I would give
          <em>Digital Minimalism</em> a shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          My summary is this: make it easier for yourself to make deliberate
          choices about how and when to use your phone and other technology. So
          much of my current phone use is just a reflex, and I want to change
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t think there is anything revolutionary in this book. But it was
          full of good, timeless advice and ideas, sort of like talking to your
          friend who listens to a lot of podcasts. It made me think and reflect.
          Who knew books could do that.
        </p>
        <h3>My Digital Minimalism Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          I didn’t feel like going through the 30 day purge like Newport
          suggests. But I took some time to evaluate what I could do anyway.
          Here’s what I came up with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I deleted Twitter, Reddit, and Hulu from my phone. These are my
            biggest time-wasters. I also blocked Twitter through Screen Time on
            iOS. I still have these on my iPad so that I can use them when I
            make a deliberate decision to.
          </li>
          <li>
            I only watch whatever I’m binging at the moment while I’m riding the
            exercise bike.
          </li>
          <li>
            I removed high volume RSS feeds like The Verge. Now I don’t feel the
            need to open my RSS reader often to check the latest news.
          </li>
          <li>
            I cut down the number of podcasts I’m subscribed to—admittedly, I
            have more work to do here since I’m still subscribed to 25…
          </li>
          <li>
            When I move into my new house, I would like to have a local
            newspaper delivered.
          </li>
          <li>
            Switch to the iPhone 12 Mini. I was planning on upgrading to the
            Max, but I thought that maybe having a smaller screen would make me
            less likely to use my phone for things like watching videos and
            reading. I’m not certain this is <em>actually</em> the case, but I
            do love the size of the Mini.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I’m also experimenting with a pocket notebook. So far I’ve been using
          it to plan my weeks and sometimes days. I also use it to record ideas
          and other thoughts. I’m still figuring out how exactly I want to use
          this, but it has already reduced my dependence on my phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two main things that cause me to pickup my phone
          often—podcasts and time tracking. I suppose I could use the Toggl
          website instead of using
          <a href="https://timeryapp.com" class="external-link">Timery</a>, but
          the Timery widget just makes it so easy. I've also experimented with
          listening to podcasts on my Apple Watch. I actually like using my
          watch quite a bit—I don’t need to pick up my phone when I go somewhere
          else in the house. But it is not always reliable. The podcast I want
          to listen to is not always on my watch when I want to listen, so I
          often still use my phone. I use
          <a href="https://overcast.fm" class="external-link">Overcast</a
          >—because of it’s superior Smart Speed® and Voice Boost®—but maybe I
          should look into other options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, I feel like all this is making a difference. I don’t feel the
          need to always have my phone on me. I feel more engaged when I’m just
          hanging out with the family. Overall, I’m on board with the idea of
          using your phone less. I’ll take another look in a couple months and
          see what I need to adjust and tweak, maybe to do the whole 30 day
          purge that he suggests. Perhaps, Phase 2 will be when I switch to a
          rotary landline for all communication—buttons would make it too easy
          to call people.
        </p>
