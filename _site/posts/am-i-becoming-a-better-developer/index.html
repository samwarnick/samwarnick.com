        <p>
          I've been working full-time as a software developer for almost 2 years
          now. I’ve learned a lot. I’ve messed a bunch of stuff up too. The
          question I’ve been struggling with is
          <strong
            >how do I know I’m <em>actually</em> becoming a better
            developer?</strong
          >
          Over the last couple of years, I feel like I'm becoming a better
          developer. But is feeling better enough?
        </p>
        <h3>What makes a good developer, IMO?</h3>
        <p>
          I haven't worked with or known a <em>ton</em> of developers, but I've
          worked with some great ones. Besides the actual code a developer
          produces, there is lots that makes a developer great. There is lots
          that make a developer great, but here are a few things that I think
          make a developer (and people in general) great:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            They are approachable. They always have time to help the junior dev
            like me and give helpful feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            They know how to find answers. Because of this, they seem to have a
            super-human ability to know everything.
          </li>
          <li>
            They volunteer to work on the hard stuff. This leads to them
            learning more because they stretch themselves.
          </li>
          <li>They admit when they don't know something.</li>
          <li>They are not afraid to admit they were wrong.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, all these things are hard to measure. I think most
          people can agree that the easy things to measure (number of lines
          written, number of tickets closed, etc.) have little bearing on
          whether a developer is great. So that's where I get stuck. I want to
          get better, I know what I think a good developer looks like, but how
          do I know I am better than I was a week, a month, a year ago?
        </p>
        <h3>Can getting better be measured?</h3>
        <p>
          I like numbers. They are easy to compare. But how do I compare
          something like being approachable? I could maybe find a number to
          represent it, like number of questions I get a day. I could ask people
          to give me a rating on how approachable they think I am, but I'm
          guessing the people who like me would rate me highly and the people
          who don't would rate me poorly, and that it wouldn't change much over
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's assume I do find a number or a couple numbers to represent
          approachability. Over time, I think I would subconsciously, or maybe
          even consciously, find a way to game that number. I'd want to chase
          that good feeling that comes from seeing a number improve. My point
          is, numbers probably won't work very well. Are all metrics bad? No.
          Are most? Maybe. It's hard to find the useful metrics. But they do
          exist, I think. But I also know from personal experience that it is
          incredibly easy to focus too much on the number and not on the end
          result the number is supposed to measure.
        </p>
        <h3>So, is feeling better enough?</h3>
        <p>
          I'm now thinking yes, just feeling like you're a better developer is
          probably enough.
        </p>

          The hosts of one of my favorite podcasts,
          <a href="https://relay.fm/cortex" class="external-link">Cortex</a>,
          talk about yearly themes. Instead of making yearly goals or
          resolutions, they have a theme. Whenever a decision or opportunity
          comes up, you can just look at your theme determine if the decision is
          on or off theme. I think a similar tactic can be taken with becoming a
          better developer. Instead of creating specific goals or measuring
          (pointless) metrics, just keep what you think makes a developer great
          in mind, and when situations arise, just ask, &quot;How would a great
          developer act in this situation?&quot;. Sounds cheesy, I know. But
          that's the best I can come up with right now. It's not just wanting to
          be a better developer that makes someone better. It is knowing what
          you want to be like and acting more and more like that until you
          become that.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any ideas or thoughts, let me know. I’d appreciate it.
          This is all still forming in my mind. What do you think makes a
          developer great? How do you know that you're getting better?
        </p>
