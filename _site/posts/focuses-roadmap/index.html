        <p>
          I had to cut myself off on adding new features to Focuses pretty early
          on. If I let myself keep going, I probably never would've released.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a few things on my roadmap that I would like to work on.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Better iPad support. This might be my biggest priority. Current iPad
            support is basic at best. I wanted to launch with multiple device
            support using CloudKit. I had never used CloudKit before, so I'm
            glad I went ahead, because I quickly found I did things wrong. A lot
            of people's data would not have synced if I added it later. Anyway,
            my focus was on getting Focuses onto iPad, not making a good iPad
            app. There's a lot about making good iPad apps that I just don't
            know, so I'm excited to learn.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data import/export. I think it would be nice to be able to export
            all the data as a CSV or something. Importing will be a little
            tricky because I will have to think about how to handle existing
            data. I could always start with just export.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shortcuts support. There's a few shortcuts that I think might be
            useful.
          </li>
          <li>
            Watch app. I've never built a watch app before, so that would be
            kind of fun.
          </li>
          <li>
            Graphs and trends. Some beta testers said that having graphs might
            be nice. While I think the calendar view does a pretty good job, I'm
            going to explore this. Perhaps a way to view week by week or month
            by month instead of day by day. Or a way to see at a glance if
            you're doing better or worse on a particular focus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Widget. I've also never made a widget, so again, lots to figure out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Smarter and richer notifications. Right now, notifications are
            pretty basic, once a day at the same time, regardless of if you've
            entered scores or not. There's a lot of opportunity here to do more.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There's more on my list, but these are probably the biggest. If you
          have any ideas, or your favorite feature is missing, let me know on
