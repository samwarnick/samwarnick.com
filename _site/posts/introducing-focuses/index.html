        <p>
          Focuses is my take on goal and habit tracking. It is inspired by Myke
          Hurley's daily themes and Marshall Goldsmith's daily active questions.
          The idea is to have a simple and flexible system for scoring yourself
          on how you do towards your goals each day. There are 3 options, an
          empty circle, and half-filled circle, and a filled circle. What these
          mean is up to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          When SwiftUI was announced at WWDC 2019, I began thinking of projects
          I could try it out on. An idea for a daily questions app kept coming
          back to me. It would be an app that asked you the questions you wanted
          each day. Stuff like &quot;How did you do towards eating healthy
          today?&quot; You would respond with some like &quot;Bad&quot; or
          &quot;Good&quot;. I started a version of this app, but abandoned it. I
          didn't like that approach. It felt too constrained.
        </p>
        <p>
          While listening to
          <a href="https://relay.fm/cortex" class="external-link">Cortex</a>, I
          heard Myke talking about his system of rating himself on a scale of 0,
          1, or 2. Those scores would add up to a daily score. I really liked
          that approach. It felt flexible and easy to track. I tried it on
          paper, but it didn't stick. So with the New Year fast approaching, I
          thought why not try to make a simple app to do it for me? I'm a novice
          iOS developer at best, so what I thought would be simple was not so
          simple for me. But after about 3 months of slow and steady work, I'm
          excited to release the first version of Focuses!
        </p>
        <p>
          I made the app for myself. I use it everyday. Tracking my effort
          towards my goals has had a tangible effect on my life. It's helped me
          and I hope it can help others.
        </p>
