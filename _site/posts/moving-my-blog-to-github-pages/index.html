        <p>
          My blog has moved around a lot. Most recently (and only for a couple
          months), I was using a self-hosted
          <a href="https://ghost.org/developers/" class="external-link"
            >Ghost</a
          >
          instance on DigitalOcean. As much as I liked Ghost, I was looking for
          something a little more hands off—I didn't love being greeted with a
          new update notification nearly every time I logged in, requiring me to
          SSH in and upgrade. I also wanted something I could manage a little
          more easily from my iPad. Not for any good reason; just for fun. A
          friend of mine has always suggested I try out GitHub Pages and Jekyll,
          so I decided to try it out. Now, I haven't been on GitHub pages for
          very long, so these are just my initial thoughts.
        </p>
        <h3>GitHub Pages and Jekyll</h3>
        <p>
          GitHub pages is a simple way to host a personal site. It just uses a
          repo on GitHub and
          <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="external-link">Jekyll</a> to
          build a static site. Basically, all you have to do is provide the
          files for Jekyll to build. At it's simplest, all you need is an
          <code>index.html</code>. Like they say on the
          <a href="https://pages.github.com" class="external-link"
            >GitHub Pages</a
          >
          site:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Just edit, push, and your changes are live.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here are a few pros and cons for me:</p>
        <h4>Pros</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Free</li>
          <li>Easy to setup</li>
          <li>Dead simple and doesn't come with a ton of bloat</li>
          <li>Built in version control, because, you know...GitHub</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cons</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Can't preview drafts</li>
          <li>
            Doesn't support SSL and HTTPS with custom domains (you can use
            <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com" class="external-link"
              >Cloudflare</a
            >
            as a workaround)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I enjoy being able to just push changes to my repo and not having to
          deal with SSH or Mosh or FTP or whatever. For me, it's by far the
          simplest solution I've come across. GitHub even emails you if there's
          a problem build the files you've just pushed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Jekyll is a static site generator, it's obviously not going to
          be the right solution for every project, but for a simple blog, it's
          pretty perfect. I'm able to make page templates in HTML and the
          <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" class="external-link"
            >Liquid</a
          >
          templating language, all my styling in SCSS, and write my posts in
          Markdown. Mostly, I followed the
          <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/" class="external-link"
            >Jekyll docs</a
          >
          to build my own theme. Since Jekyll sites don't come with a ton of
          bloat, it was quite easy to make a theme. Not a whole lot to worry
          about. I made a <code>default</code> layout and a
          <code>post</code> layout which extends the <code>default</code>. The
          <code>default</code> has all the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> stuff, the
          header and footer, and a place to put the body content, so the other
          layouts I make don't have to worry about that stuff because they just
          extend it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jekyll can also have plugins. GitHub has several useful plugins
          whitelisted. They have some by default plugins like
          <code>jekyll-optional-front-matter</code> and
          <code>jekyll-paginate</code> in addition to some optional ones like
          <code>jekyll-seo-tag</code> and <code>jekyll-sitemap</code>. You just
          configure them in your <code>_config.yml</code>. Pretty cool. If you
          are developing locally, you need to make sure that you install them
          using <code>gem install</code> in addition to adding them to your
          <code>_config.yml</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long story short, I have found GitHub pages and Jekyll to be a simple
          way to make and manage my site. Win!
        </p>
        <h3>iPadability</h3>
        <p>
          I recently got an iPad Pro. Since I got it, it's been a mission of
          mine to figure out how to do more dev work. I'll write more about what
          I've found in another post, but let's just say, the iPad won't be
          replacing my laptop anytime soon. Despite this, GitHub Pages fits
          really well into an iPad workflow. iPads obviously can't run any fancy
          command line tools, but luckily GitHub Pages builds the Jekyll page
          for you! So, using the fantastic
          <a
            href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8"
            class="external-link"
            >Working Copy</a
          >, I can keep a local version of my repo on my iPad. For code changes,
          I can make small changes (usually in
          <a
            href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor-6/id1049254261?mt=8"
            class="external-link"
            >Textastic</a
          >, push them, and boom—GitHub builds it for me and my changes are
          there. Yes, it's not as good as a feedback loop as running a local
          Jekyll server and making changes, but hey, its an iPad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing posts on the iPad is even better. Jekyll has some rules for a
          post to be valid: the file needs to be in the format
          <code>YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md</code> and the post needs valid
          frontmatter. I thought to myself, hey, that's something a computer
          should be able to do for me. Luckily
          <a
            href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8"
            class="external-link"
            >Workflow</a
          >
          on iOS has some pretty great automation tools. I was able to make a
          workflow that will take a markdown file, format it correctly for
          Jekyll, save it in Working Copy, commit it, and finally push it to
          GitHub. With a single tap, I can now do what would normally take
          several minutes and who knows how many taps. I don't know about you,
          but I think that's pretty cool. You can find it
          <a
            href="https://workflow.is/workflows/6094b228a4ae499b884634152cd3ab48"
            class="external-link"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it's much easier to manage on my iPad than having to SSH into my
          DigitalOcean droplet to update things. Still not perfect, but with the
          current state of iOS, it's not too shabby.
        </p>

        <p>
          There you have it—more than you'd ever want to know about me moving my
          blog to GitHub Pages! I recommend giving it a try sometime.
