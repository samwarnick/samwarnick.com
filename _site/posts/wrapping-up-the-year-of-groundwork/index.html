        <p>
          2020 has been a hard year for everyone. But I have been very
          fortunate. I was already working from home, my company does well in
          good and bad economic times, my D&amp;D group was online already, and
          my daughter is not in school yet. So I know I have had it a whole lot
          easier than most people. In all honesty, I feel like 2020 has been one
          of my better years. If it wasn’t for the stress of building a house
          during a pandemic and living with my in-laws, I would feel pretty
          great right now. Not having to go to places like church or work events
          has reduced my base-level of anxiety quite a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          My theme for 20202 was the year of groundwork. I wanted to do things
          that would help me open doors in the future. A couple things I had in
          mind were release an iOS app and start freelancing a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I did well in both of those areas. Though, at times I did feel
          like I was overextending myself at times.
        </p>
        <h3>Freelancing</h3>
        <p>
          My plan had been to release Focuses and then start doing some
          freelance work. Focuses took more of my energy than I was expecting.
          But in the late Summer, I set up an LLC as a first step. Right after I
          did that, a former coworker called me up and asked if I was interested
          in taking over some side-work of his. I was very lucky.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Started some ongoing freelance work in September.</li>
          <li>
            Have made enough money to do things like max out my HSA to help pay
            for a new baby next year.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Focuses</h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focuses/id1492385864#?platform=iphone"
            class="external-link"

          is probably my biggest personal success of 2020. It made me stretch
          and I learned a lot doing it. I'm proud of it. I feel like it was
          worth the effort I put into it, which was a lot—nearly 200 hours in
          2020.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Released in March 2020.</li>
          <li>
            Released 11 additional updates throughout the year. Only a couple
            were to fix pretty egregious oversights of a previous release 😃.
          </li>
          <li>
            It made some money. Not much at all, but enough to pay for my
            developer account and domain name.
          </li>
          <li>It was written about on a couple websites.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition to freelancing and Focuses, I also did a decent job of
          waking up early to work on side-projects, I read a lot of books (for
          me), and I exercised a few times a week. So in 2021, I’d like to keep
          going on the good habits I developed during 2020. But honestly, I
          don’t feel like I have much gas left in the tank. I need to be careful
          in 2021 to not completely burn myself out.
        </p>
