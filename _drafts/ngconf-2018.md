## TL;DR
Angular is a frontend JS framework and I went to a conference about it. Expect some short write ups of some of the things I learned.

This last week, I was able to attend ngConf in Salt Lake City, UT. It was a 3 day conference dedicated to Angular. It was the first conference I've been to. Im not big on "networking" or "talking to people", so I was fortunate to be able to go with a group of about a dozen coworkers.
