## TL;DR
I finished a client project, and got paid.

A little bit ago, I finished my first project for a client, [totalpowerandfoam.com](https://totalpowerandfoam.com). Itâ€™s a simple single page landing page.

Here's what it looks like:

I really tried to give it a clean professional look without being too boring. Early drafts of the site were way too boring. But by adding shadows and a hero image, I think it came out looking real nice.

As always, hit me up on Twitter if you have any feedback. I'm definitely learning as I go.
