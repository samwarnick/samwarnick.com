title: "CSS Variables?"
date: 2016-07-28

I justÂ found out, I think two days ago, that CSS has native variables. I discovered this while looking through some generated code from [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/). CSS preprocessors like LESS and Sass give us this ability, and probably do it pretty well. I donâ€™t really know. I havenâ€™t sued them much. For whatever reasons, I like writing plain CSS. So, without further ado, hereâ€™s an example of CSS variables:

Apparently this has been around since 2014-ish, as far as I can tell. `:root` is a pseudo-class which, in most contexts, represents the `<html>` tag. More on :root can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root). As you can see in the snippet, the variable starts with `--`. This sets it apart as a [custom property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*). Custom properties can be usedÂ as variables using `var()`! How cool. Because the custom properties are defined in `:root`, they are global. Thereâ€™s all sorts of inheritance things with that, for better or worse.Â [Browser support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables#Browser_compatibility) is pretty good, with one notable exception (Iâ€™m looking at you IEâ€¦ðŸ™„). Thatâ€™s why line 7 exists in the snippet. It defines the color just incase someone has no idea what to do with `var()`. Seems kinda redundant, but itâ€™s not the end of the world. Just a minor/mild nuisance. Itâ€™s not CSSâ€™s fault though. Maybe Edge supports it? I donâ€™t know. Maybe no one will use IE again? Hopefully. I need to do more browser testing with it myself. Maybe thereâ€™s a gulp and/or webpack tool that can automatically insert that fallback line for you. I should look into that.

So thatâ€™s a brief overview of CSS variables. I think itâ€™s pretty cool because it lessens our dependency on preprocessors and such. The end.
