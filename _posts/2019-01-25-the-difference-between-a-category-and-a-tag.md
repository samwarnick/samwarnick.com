No one has asked me this question, yet I still feel the need to talk about it for no good reason at all. I guess mainly to get it straight in my head. 

A category is basically “What section in the bookstore to I go to find this?” A tag would then be “What’s this book about?” Easy enough. 

Well. That was easier to to explain to myself than I thought. Have a great day.
