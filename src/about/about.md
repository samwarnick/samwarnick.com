# About myself

As my daughter says, I'm just a tired dad, with a tired name, **Sam Warnick**. I'm a software developer in Beaufort, SC.

## Some things I do

-   [I have an iOS app I work on occasionally](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focuses/id1492385864?ls=1). It's called Focuses and is meant to help you...focus.
-   I eat a lot of Oreos. Like, a lot.
-   I collect LEGO sets.
-   [I do a podcast with my oldest daughter](https://lilyandsam.show).
