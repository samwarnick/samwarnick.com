# **Some things I do**{.text-xl .font-semibold}

-   [I have an iOS app I work on occasionally](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focuses/id1492385864?ls=1). It's called Focuses and is meant to help you...focus.
-   I created and maintain a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) called [Simple Embeds](https://github.com/samwarnick/obsidian-simple-embeds).
-   I eat a lot of Oreos. Like, a lot.
-   I collect LEGO sets.
-   [I occasionally do a podcast with my oldest daughter](https://lilyandsam.show).
