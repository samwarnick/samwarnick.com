![A headshot of Sam Warnick smiling](/media/profile.jpeg "Me!")

I'm Sam Warnick. I'm a husband, dad, and developer. I mostly write Angular for my day job, but I dabble in Ruby. On the side, I tinker with iOS apps with Swift and SwiftUI. Other than that, hobbies is my hobby. But no matter what my current hobby is, I'm probably also writing code, and buying, collecting, and building LEGO. I burn out easily.
