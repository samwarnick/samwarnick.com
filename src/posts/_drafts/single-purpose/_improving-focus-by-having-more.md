title: Improving Focus by Having More
subtitle: Why I bought an iPod touch in 2021

I get distracted. Easily. I'm the kind of person that gets a message and somehow ends up reading about the KGB stealing plans for the space shuttle to build Buran in between the time of looking at the notification and the phone unlocking.

My first attempt at focusing more and being less distracted was to just have less stuff. My dream was to be able to use an iPad for everything. In college, I tried using my iPad Mini for notes, textbooks, and other reading. Later, when I got the iPad Pro 10.5", I tried using it for drawing, reading, writing, gaming, and even programming. It was more successful at all these than the Mini, but with programming being my job and my hobby, it wasn't a great experience overall. I _really_ wanted to be an iPad guy, and it took me a long time to figure out that it's not for me.

My life changed (when _doesn't_ your life change?) when my wife got me a Kindle for my birthday. The Kindle is for reading books and that's pretty much it.
