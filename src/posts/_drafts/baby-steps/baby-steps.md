This is a little bit of a follow-up to [Fresh Starts](/posts/fresh-starts).

It took me so long to start developing my habits and routines again because it felt overwhelming. It took me most of 2020 to develop all the new habits and routines; the thought of doing all that work again was daunting. I procrastinated and did nothing. Much easier.

I was feeling pretty awful. I knew I need to make changes, again. I realized that it wouldn't be as much work the second time around. I already knew that I could wake up early, exercise regularly, read, eat less junk. I just had to do it.

I have never been this deliberate or methodical in create habits. It's usually a bit more organic. But I think it worked out this way because I'm trying to rebuild habits that I already had. I know exactly what I want to be doing, so it's a lot easy to plan it and work towards it.
