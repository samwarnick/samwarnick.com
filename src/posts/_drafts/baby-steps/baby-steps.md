This is a little bit of a follow-up to [Fresh Starts](/posts/fresh-starts).

One reason it took me so long to start developing my habits and routines again was that it felt overwhelming. To make it easier, I decided to take it a bit at a time. First I started reading again. Then I started exercising again. Then waking up earlier. Now I'm focusing on working on side projects. After that, maybe eating healthy again...if I can convince myself to stop buying Oreos every time I go grocery shopping.
