Last week was Thanksgiving and I took some time off. My family went to a beach house for the week. I brought my journal, my laptop, and running shoes. I had good intentions. But when I'm out of my element, I have a real hard time sticking to the routines I have at home. So I mostly did nothing I intended to doâ€”except I went running once when the tide lined up with the time I usually run at.

It was good to have a break though. I've been working pretty consistently on some side projects, so it was nice to give my brain a break and eat far too much apple pie.

I was excited to get back into the swing of things this week, but then my family and myself got sick. So now I'm trying to figure out how much I should rest versus stick to my routine. My brain isn't in tiptop shape right now, so not sure how productive I would be working on some apps. But at the same time, I don't want to go 2 weeks without working on anything. That would be hard to come back from. I should probably find some lighter weight tasks to work on.

Anyway, sticking to routines is hard, especially when you're on "vacation" with kids!
