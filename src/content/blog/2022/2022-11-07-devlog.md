So I've got a bug. You select a collection and then add a new idea. Problem is, new idea does not show up. And I have no idea why. The value changes, but the View does not update. The first view does, but none of the others. The Views are in a `TabView`. Maybe that has something to do with it? I've tried making the View as simple as just showing the count of ideas. Nothing. I've tried the ol' add an id to the view and change it every time it updates. Again, nothing. I'm going to have to try and make a  minimal reproducible example. Guess I'll try that tomorrow. It's just so strange—the fetch request updates, but the View seems to refuse to recognize the change. I like using `@FetchRequest`, but I'm afraid I'm going to need to refactor everything to avoid using it.
