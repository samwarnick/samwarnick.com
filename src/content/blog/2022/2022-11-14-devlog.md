I meant to work on Lightbulbs today, but then I started having an [existential crisis of sorts](https://twitter.com/samwarnick/status/1592242979556950016). I've long struggled with working on projects in a sustainable way. But now I'm struggling with motivation. How do I make something that I want to keep working on even if it is no longer just for me and my interests, workflows, perspectives, etc. change. I feel like I start a lot of things to try and fix a problem I have, but then my problem works itself out in some other way.

Like with [Simple Embeds](https://github.com/samwarnick/obsidian-simple-embeds), I was really excited about it in the beginning, people started using it, I put a lot of time into it, then I pretty much stopped using Obsidian. People are still asking for things and reporting bugs and stuff, but I have a _really_ hard time making myself work on it. Feels like a chore.

I'm trying to figure out how to either make myself want to work on things like that, or probably even better, figure out how to prevent getting into that situation in the first place.

That's what's going through my head right now. I think it still all comes back to how to build things sustainably.
