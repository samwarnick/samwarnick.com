I'm already stretching the limits of my Swift knowledge. I'm looking at the [multi search endpoint](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/multi-search). It can return a Movie, TV Show, or Person, all together. I'm unsure how to handle that with `Codable`. It's no problem in JS or even TS. I think I need to somehow create some sort of container to handle them all.

I found [this lib](https://github.com/adamayoung/TMDb/blob/main/Sources/TMDb/Models/Media.swift). Taking a look at how they handle it, and they seem to use enums for it. An interesting solution that I don't completely understand. Going to study it more.
