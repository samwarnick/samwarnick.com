Spent some time setting up my own Mastodon instance. Mostly just to try it out. I'm not sure if I'll keep it going—managing a server I don't really need sounds hard. It's fun having [@sam@warnick.me](https://social.warnick.me/@sam) as my handle though.

I mostly followed two guides and setup my instance on a Linode with Docker:
- https://www.bentasker.co.uk/posts/blog/general/running-mastodon-in-docker-compose.html
- https://gist.github.com/TrillCyborg/84939cd4013ace9960031b803a0590c4

I'm actually hosting the instance at https://social.warnick.me, but I wanted the handle to be @warnick.me. This wasn't too difficult. Just needed to set `LOCAL_DOMAIN` and `WEB_DOMAIN` properly in `.env.production`, the update my nginx config to [redirect the webfinger](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/config/#web_domain) correctly. After those changes, it seems to be working?

I had a couple things stump me, but that was mostly me not being able to read. I missed that I needed to change my roots in the nginx config and a couple other things. But also, I ran the setup script, put in all the information, and it asked "Do you want me to save this to .env.production?" Yes please. And then it just didn't. So I needed to add a few config options it was missing. And I put in the wrong values at a couple points so the web server couldn't start up and I didn't really know how to see the logs to debug because I'm a Docker n00b.

Then for funs, I made [@blog@warnick.me](https://social.warnick.me/@blog) and set up an IFTTT automation to post every time I post to the blog—[followed this blog](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2022/12/15/rss-to-mastodon/). Going to try that now...
