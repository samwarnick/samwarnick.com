Lightbulbs is intended to be an app for collecting ideas. But I think I got too caught up on implementing the UI that it's headed towards becoming a generic list app. Everyone has a place that they can put ideas. So I think I want to change the focus from *collecting* ideas to *coming up with* ideas. The app will help come up with an idea, record it, and then put it wherever you want. Maybe it's a bad idea...but I think it's simpler. Eventually, I think I could bring back all the collecting, favoriting, and other features.

So, gonna start over. Again.

I don't think everything I've done so far will go to waste. There is plenty that can be reused.
