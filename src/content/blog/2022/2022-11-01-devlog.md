Taking a little break from dev work. Should get back to it tomorrow though.

Today, I decided to take a look at [Blot](https://blot.im). My current website is pretty much held together with baling wire. I've got my own weird micropub integration so I can post from iA Writer which adds files to my git repo on GitHub. The older I get, the less I want to deal with stuff like that. I also want an easier blogging experience. So far, Blot seems to give me that. I'm trying out Dropbox for syncing, and I can still use iA Writer. So far so good. Copied all my posts from my repo and moved them to my [Blot site](https://samwarnick.blot.im). Gonna give it a whirl a bit more before switching over, but things look promising. Still need to try making a custom theme.
