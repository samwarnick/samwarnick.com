Just been working on some small polish things. Like real small things—make sure the buttons have the right color. So I over-engineered it! I always forget how to make custom `ButtonStyle`, so putting this here for reference. I have a view modifier for the shared stuff between multiple button styles that can simply be used like `.buttonBase`. Than to style a button, `.buttonStyle(.primaryButton)`. Easy! Definitely worth the effort for the 2 buttons I have. But did do some Swift generics stuff which is always exciting...

```swift
struct ButtonBase<S: ShapeStyle>: ViewModifier {
    let background: S
    let isPressed: Bool

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .padding(.horizontal, 20)
            .padding(.vertical, 6)
            .background(background)
            .opacity(isPressed ? 0.5 : 1)
    }
}

extension View {
    func buttonBase<S: ShapeStyle>(background: S, isPressed: Bool) -> some View {
        modifier(ButtonBase(background: background, isPressed: isPressed))
    }
}

struct PrimaryButton: ButtonStyle {
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) private var colorScheme

    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        configuration.label
            .buttonBase(background: Color.primary, isPressed: configuration.isPressed)
    }
}

extension ButtonStyle where Self == PrimaryButton {
    static var primary: Self {
        return .init()
    }
}
```
