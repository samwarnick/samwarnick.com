I'm still procrastinating and thinking about stuff. So I decided to tinker with a couple things I've never done. I was playing around with Federico Viticci's incredible [Apple Frames shortcut](https://www.macstories.net/ios/apple-frames-3-0-completely-rewritten-support-for-iphone-14-pro-and-dynamic-island-new-devices-multiple-display-resolutions-and-more/), and thought, how do you combine 2 images in an app? So decided to give it a try in a SwiftUI Mac app.

![Frames demo](/media/2022-11-16-frames-demo.mp4){.narrow}

Basically, I have a `ZStack` with 2 images and then use [`ImageRenderer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/imagerenderer) to create and image I can save to disk. Pretty cool!

I'm using the `.onDrop` modifier. It gives you an array of `NSItemProvider`. I've never used that before, so not totally sure what I can do with it yet. But for now, I call `loadDataRepresentation` which gives a `Progress` which I also don't know how to use. I found it interesting that there doesn't seem to be an `async` alternative for `loadDataRepresentation`, still takes a completion handler. Might just be missing it though. Anyway, lots of things to explore.
