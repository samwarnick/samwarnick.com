Spent some time making my Blot blog look more like my current blog. I think it turned out nicely. I couldn't get the Blot local environment running, and seems that [others have the same issue](https://blot.im/questions/922) right now. Also couldn't get [local theme to sync](https://blot.im/questions/1028), so I did everything on the online editor. It was a bit of a pain, but I managed.

Got back into Lightbulbs, my WIP iOS app for collecting ideas. Was having a crash when adding a collection. I'm converting a `FetchedResults` to an `Array` as the data source for the view causing the issue. The issue was that the new collection was not in that array at the time a `onChange` was called. So I added another `onChange` to check for when the array changes and run the logic to set the variable again with the new values. A little weird. The closure gets passed the new value as expected, but the variable in the view is still the previous value. But I don't think that's how it's supposed to work. [The docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onchange(of:perform:)) mention capturing the previous value:

```swift
.onChange(of: playState) { [playState] newState in
    model.playStateDidChange(from: playState, to: newState)
}
```

It seems that this is a result of passing the state into another View:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var value = 1

    var body: some View {
        MyLabel(value: value)
        Button("Increment value") {
            value += 1
        }
    }
}

struct MyLabel: View {
    let value: Int

    var body: some View {
        Text(value.formatted())
            .onChange(of: value) { newValue in
                print(value, newValue)
            }
    }
}
```

Maybe there's a better way to do this. Need to look into state management again. But at least in this situation, it seems to be the case that when `onChange` gets called in `MyLabel`, `value` is always the old value.
