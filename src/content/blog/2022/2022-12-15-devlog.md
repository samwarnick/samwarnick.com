Was having a hard time with decoding some JSON. Was banging my head for like 30 mins. Turns out, I was simply trying to decode it as the wrong type‚Äîitself rather than a string ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I think I finally understand using an enum to decode values that could be multiple types. So in my case, `results` is an array that can hold `Movie`, `TVShow`, or `Person`. Can't really throw in `let results: [Movie | TVShow | Person]` like you can in TypeScript. So, I made `Media`, which is an enum of `movie`, `tvShow`, and `person`. Helpfully, each type of media has the key `media_type`, so you know what you're dealing with. When `Media` is being decoded, we look for `media_type`, and then  based on that, create an enum with the correct associated type. Pretty cool. This is all pretty much stolen from [an existing Swift TMDb library](https://github.com/adamayoung/TMDb/blob/main/Sources/TMDb/Models/Media.swift). Honestly, don't know if I would've ever come up with this solution, and I doubt I explained it very clearly. But I like it, and I'm not sure there are any other great solutions. When I get to the UI‚Äîwhich is taking me quite a while to get to...‚ÄîI could use the enum to easily pick the correct View to use. Enums in Swift are powerful and I need to explore them more.

```swift
enum Media: Decodable {

    case movie(Movie)
    case tvShow(TVShow)
    case person(Person)

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case mediaType
    }

    private enum MediaType: String, Decodable, Equatable {
        case movie
        case tvShow = "tv"
        case person
    }

    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        let mediaType = try container.decode(MediaType.self, forKey: .mediaType)

        switch mediaType {
            case .movie:
                self = .movie(try Movie(from: decoder))
            case .tvShow:
                self = .tvShow(try TVShow(from: decoder))
            case .person:
                self = .person(try Person(from: decoder))
        }
    }
}
```
