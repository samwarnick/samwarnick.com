The YouTube algorithm got me today and suggested a video about a font called [Comic Code](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code) by Toshi Omagari. I was immediately intrigued. As I was just about to buy it, I decided to look around a bit. I stumbled upon [Codelia](https://tosche.net/fonts/codelia), also by Omagari. It was love at first sight. Codelia has a similar feel of softness the Comic Code does, while feeling a little more professional and refined. It was on sale and I bought it.
