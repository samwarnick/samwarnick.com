For whatever reason, about once a year, I get an itch to blog. I'm feeling it now. Maybe it's because there's more light in the day and I feel like I have more energy. Maybe I just want a new thing to tinker with. I'm not totally sure. But I'm just going with it.

I've got a list of things I'd like to write aboutâ€”yes, some of them are left over from when I tried blogging last year. Nothing I have to say is very important or profound. I wholly expect that I will be the only person to read whatever I write. And that's okay with me.

I've lowered my expectations and simplified my process[^1]. So, I'm setup for success ðŸ˜€.
