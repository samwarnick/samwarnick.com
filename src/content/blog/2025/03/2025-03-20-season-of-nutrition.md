It's spring now. The Season of Waking Up is coming to an end, and the Season of Nutrition is beginning. 

## Season of Waking up

Waking up early has gotten really hard. I'm just exhausted. Lately, instead of waking up at 5:30, I sometimes sleep through until my second alarm at 6:30, or even my third alarm at 7:00. Exercise is usually what gets cut first. I just find exercise that is not running outside so boring. But I still feel so much better when I stick to my plan and wake up at 5:30, work on a project or whatever, and exercise. 

I'm not perfect at keeping track, but here are some HabitKit charts:

All things considered, I think these look decent. I'm calling this a success. I feel so much better when I stick to it; it has basically become a habit. One thing I need to improve is having a clear idea of what I want to do when I wake up. If I don't have a plan, I often stay in bed and fall back asleep.

Like I said in my [first post](/blog/2025-and-the-year-of-health/), my hope is to create and persist healthy habits. So I'm not stopping waking up early now that winter is over. I'm building on it.

## Season of Nutrition

TL;DR, I need to be more conscious about what I put into my body and mind. So I'm going to reinstate some rules/guidelines I had a couple of years ago. The idea is simpleâ€”take in less bad stuff and more good stuff. Easier said than done.

- Intermittent fasting.
- Eat better foods.
- Drink more water.
- Use my phone less.

I've already started on a few of these for about a month.

In the past, intermittent fasting works for me. I usually eat from 11 or 12 to 7 p.m. I'm old, so eating later at night keeps me up with a tummy ache. I'm not super strict. Sometimes a smoothie in the morning is just what I need. Sometimes my wife and I get 45 mins to watch a show at night, so I make popcorn. But in general, it helps me eat less.

I'm trying real hard to just eat "better". I've been making a big batch of overnight oats each week. Oats, plain Greek yogurt, chia seeds, milk, and some maple syrup. A boring meal for a boring person...but I like it. I've also been working the last couple of weeks to just not eat treats constantly. My wife only eats treats 2 days a week, usually the weekend. So I've been trying that too. I try to replace it with more fruits and vegetables, but the last few days it's just been Chex mix we made. Less than ideal. But progress.

Supposedly water is good for you?

I've been leaving my phone in my room most of the day. I've also deleted social media apps from it. This has been helping me not just whip it out and check nothing every 30 seconds.

I need to start weighing myself again so I can track this. Just scared to see what the number is now...
