A few months ago, I sat down to start on a web version of [ScreenCred](https://screencred.app). There's no reason for it to be iOS only. I worked on that for a few days. Then I was having trouble keeping track of the tasks I needed to do. Another tour through todo apps, I decided I needed to make my own todo app. So Prefect Todos started. I worked on that for a few weeks, then determined I needed to change how I was handling templating. This led to updating my template repo. And that led to me making [perfectstack.dev](https://perfectstack.dev).

It kinda feels like in _Inception_ when they keep going one level deeper. I just keep moving from one distraction to another. I'm hoping now I can start coming back up now. [perfectstack.dev](https://perfectstack.dev) still needs a lot of work, but I got the idea out of my head. Perfect Todos has quite a bit of work left, but I think in a few weeks, or a couple of months, I can get it to a more usable place. Then, I can get back to the original project, ScreenCred web. Hopefully.

I don't think this is bad by the way. I'm just working on stuff to learn and have fun. So it doesn't really matter if I never "finish" anything. In my mind, it's all useful to work on and builds my abilities. I explore in one direction for a bit, and then come back to the original task. Things will get done eventually. Probably. Maybe.
