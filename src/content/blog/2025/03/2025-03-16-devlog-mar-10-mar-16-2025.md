I got a bit distracted this week. I was reorganizing and refactoring Perfect Todos, I realized I should update [my template repo](https://github.com/samwarnick/perfect-stack) to match.

And then I decided, maybe I should make a little site to explain what it is and how to work with it. So I started on [https://perfectstack.dev](https://perfectstack.dev). I broke a couple rules. I bought a domain instead of starting with a subdomain. And honestly, this could (and should) all be in the [README.md](https://README.md) of the template repo. But whatever. And ironically, it uses Eleventy, not the Perfect Stack.

But I'll be getting back to Perfect Todos. I'm getting to some harder design decisions that I've been avoiding.
