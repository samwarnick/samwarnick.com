 No, you're being pedantic.

I've long considered my hobby to be hobbies. The other day, I wondered, do I like hobbies or do I like projects? Maybe it's semantics, but maybe also an important distinction?

[Wikipedia defines a hobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby#:~:text=a%20regular%20activity%20that%20is%20done%20for%20enjoyment%2C%20typically%20during%20one's%20leisure%20time) as "a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time." And [defines a project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project#:~:text=a%20type%20of%20assignment%2C%20typically%20involving%20research%20or%20design%2C%20that%20is%20carefully%20planned%20to%20achieve%20a%20specific%20objective) as "a type of assignment, typically involving research or design, that is carefully planned to achieve a specific objective."

Projects often give me a chance to try new things and to research, design, plan, gather materials, and do something. A lot of the time it is the research through planning stages that are most fun for me. Execution is meh. Projects usually align themselves very closely with my interests/hobbiesâ€”organizing Pokemon cards, building a PC, making a journal, reading a book, adding onto the LEGO city, etc. I can typically juggle two projects at a time, if they relate to different interests. Or, like with my [weekend project](https://samwarnick.com/blog/weekend-project/), everything else gets put on hold until I brain dump everything out.

Projects have a pretty well defined start and finish. Some are big and some are small. My favorite projects are the ones that can be completed within a week. I've done some longer projects that are rewarding too, like [ScreenCred](https://screencred.app).

Looking at that Wikipedia definition of a hobby, I cannot think of much that I consider "a regular activity". Reading is probably the closest, but that might be more of a habit than a hobby? But really, I don't do many things regularly. I get bored when things become regular. Most things I have considered to be hobbies are really projects. I have an objective relating to an interest of mine. I do that, and move on to something else.

This distinction probably does not matter. But it kinda feels like a key to help me understand what I enjoy. Hobbies and projects are not mutually exclusive. I often feel bad for abandoning hobbies or switching focus. If I can instead change my framing to moving from one project to the next, I think that might make me feel better about things?

So, is my hobby doing projects? Does it matter? Is there a different way of looking at this? I don't know why I'm so obsessed with trying to define my hobbies. So maybe hobbies _is_ my hobby.
