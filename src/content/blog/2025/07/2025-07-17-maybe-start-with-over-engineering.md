Sometimes when I shower, I zone out. I think about what I'm going to have for lunch, what I need to do at work that day, the people who have wronged me and how I will get revenge, or projects I'm working on. The usual stuff. The problem is, sometimes I forget which shower step I'm on. Sometimes I wash my hair three times.

I'm ashamed to admit, but my first thought was "could I have an AI watch me shower so I could shout into the air and ask what's next?" That would be a bit invasive. Then I thought, well maybe it could only watch the shower products I use and know which ones I've picked up. Cameras, computers, code. More work. Then, lightbulb. _I_ could be the AI. I devised a new system for myself. Instead of putting a bottle down exactly where I picked it up, set it down a few inches away. At a quick glance I can determine which I have used based on position. After my shower, I reset them to their original places.

I got to the simple solution eventually. I think that is generally how I work. I don't think there is anything wrong with the process of starting complex and settling on simplicity. I enjoy over-engineering. It might even be a hobby. At the very least, an interest of mine. Sometimes over-engineering prevents issues in the future. Sometimes it helps you realize what the problem actually is. I see it as part of my workflow.

When I was building my [new CMS CLI](https://samwarnick.com/blog/weekend-project/), I started making it very configurable. Then I realized that it was just for me, I could really simplify the code. But by starting with the over-engineered configuration, I learned some new techniques to handle that in a CLI and also was able to refine the features of the CLI by thinking about what others _might_ want to do with it.

I think it was in a UI design course in college that I learned about this idea of the [double diamond design process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Diamond_(design_process_model)). I don't think totally accurate, but I think about it as an iterative process of discovery and refinement. That's how I like to work. Go off and explore for a bit, come back and refine ideas. I repeat as necessary when I come across new issues or ideas.

It's okay my first thought was an AI to watch me shower. The important thing is that I did not actually build that.
