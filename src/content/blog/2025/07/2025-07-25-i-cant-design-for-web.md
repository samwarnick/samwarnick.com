Since letting [my Apple Developer membership expire](https://samwarnick.com/blog/my-apple-developer-membership-has-expired/), I've been giving more thought to moving ScreenCred to the web. It's a technically simple app. But I have run into one big problemâ€”design.

Whatever web design skills I may have ever had, they have definitely atrophied. I'm stuck.

One of the things I like about developing for iOS is the design shortcuts you can take. The [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines) and SwiftUI put you in a good position to be able to build an app with a good UI and UX. That has definitely been a crutch for me.

I have not done a lot of web app design. I think I do _okay_ with content sites like my blog, but not apps. The web is hard for me. Big screens, small screens, and every screen in between[^1]. I have no idea how to design ScreenCred for the web. I'm just staring at a blank screen with no idea how to start. I should probably try _something_. Anything really.

I have work to do. Send good vibes my way.

[^1]: There is some element of that on iOS as well, but I've largely ignored iPad size classes. I struggle with utilizing more space effectively.
