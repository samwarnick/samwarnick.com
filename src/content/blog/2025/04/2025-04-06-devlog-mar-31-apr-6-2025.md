  I've been sick and unproductive, but I managed to create a script for
  organizing my Eeveelution Pokemon cards.

I was sick. My wife was sick. Our baby didn't want to sleep much. So, I slept in a lot. Didn't get much done. I did work on a little script to take all Eeveelution Pokemon cards and lay them out on binder pages. This way, I can lay out my binder with the cards I have, but leaving space for all the cards I'm missing. I tried doing this manually, but I messed up. Computers are better at it.

Hoping to get back to things this week. I think I might start back on the web version of ScreenCred. I _might_ just use Astro vs the Perfect Stack...we'll see.
