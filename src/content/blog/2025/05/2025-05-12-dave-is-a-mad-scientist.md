Over on [catskull.net](https://catskull.net/newsletter-blog-with-cloudflare-email-workers.html), Dave is working on some wild stuff. You might say he is smitten with Cloudflare, but especially email and email workers. He's created a reply system using email and Cloudflare workers and a web component. Now, [he's working on a newsletter](https://catskull.net/newsletter/5D0C0DB4-E6B9-438A-8120-FB5ACB6A4DA0) (a letter full of news, not a new sweater) as an alternative/supplement to social media. You sign up by just emailing him. A Cloudflare worker receives the email and generates a blog post from it. And I think replying to the email uses his existing reply system and they'll show up on his blog. Wild stuff. Excited to see what else he comes up with.
