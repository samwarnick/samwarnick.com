My wife is helping start a Pokémon club at our library. I thought it would be fun to make a new booster pack each month to give out to the kids. So I started working on September.

They are pretty much just copies of the [Japanese Pokémon Gym Promo packs](https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/07/lapras-ex-chikorita-hole-diggin-shovel-and-other-gym-promos-revealed-for-august-changes-to-promo-packs). I had never seen them before, but instantly fell in love with how they look. So I copied them in Affinity Designer. I'm not a very good graphic designer, so I usually need to "borrow" tried and true designs. These are just for fun anyway.

While the green color is pretty good, it is not what I was expecting. That sent me down a rabbit hole.

I first thought my printer was just bad. I have a Canon PIXMA TS9120 from about 2018. Went to Staples and had some samples printed, and they were worse.

I went through and made sure all my color profiles were correct and that I was using CMYK and all that. Nothing I changed there affected the output. AFAIK, printers are pretty good at converting when they need to.

Then I had the thought. Paper. Paper can be a huge variable. So I printed the same thing on nice glossy photo paper and my cheap copy paper.

Photo Paper:

Copy Paper:

The glossy paper is able to print far more vibrant colors compared to my cheap Target copy paper.

I then found a Soft Proof layer you can add in Affinity Designer that does a decent job of simulating what it will look like printed. If you're able to get a proper profile for your printer and paper, it will look even better, especially if your monitor is calibrated.

I used a lot of ink experimenting. But I'm not mad. It's important to understand the constraints of what you are working with. Sure, it's disappointing that I can't get the exact color of green on the paper I want, but that's part of the design challenge. I'll be experimenting more with other papers. I need something in the 24 to 28 lb range for easy folding. Excited to see what I find and I'm excited to make more of these booster packs!
