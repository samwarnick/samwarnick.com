I realized that after I posted about [trying to make OG images work on Cloudflare](https://samwarnick.com/blog/i-just-want-to-generate-an-og-image/), I stopped doing almost anything. No side projects. No blogging. No nothing. Well, not nothing, but a lot of binging shows. It broke me. Or I broke me.

Well, I almost feel like working on stuff again. Not quite yet, but almost. I can feel it coming.

Perfect is the enemy of good. I struggle with this. A lot. Trying to perfect things is kind of a hobby. Not a very good one though. In my efforts to simplify how I work on and build side projects, I often focus more on doing things the "right" way instead of just doing things. Sometimes that's fun, but then you try to generate an OG image with a Cloudflare worker and reconsider your life choices. The other thing I optimize for is free. I originally started building ScreenCred for Cloudflare workers because I thought I could get it running for free. I'm constantly bumping up against limitations of free plans and that is frustrating. Like if I just paid $15/mo for a decent VPS, that would get rid of a lot of my stress. "Just" run a NodeJS server on a VPS. But paying for something that _could_ be free feels like defeat and an admission of weakness.

So I need to figure out some things. Free or ease. "Right" or working. Modern or boring. Answers might seem obvious to you, but they are not to me.
