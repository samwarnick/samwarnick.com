# Apple Watch & AirPods

Running is the only exercise I enjoy and it is 100% because of the Apple Watch and AirPods. Being able to go for a run and listen to podcasts without a phone in my pocket or strapped to my arm is liberating. I've been running regularly for about eight years now and it is because of this. The workout tracking is nice, but really, it's podcasts—I don't think I'd run if I could only listen to music. The Apple Watch and AirPods helped make exercise a habit. That habit will probably help me live longer. 🤞🏻

# Certain Dri Antiperspirant

As embarrassing as it is to admit, I have really sweaty armpits. I work from home so I mostly brushed it off. But it started to really get to me. It was to the point that I dreaded going out in public out of fear of maybe getting embarrassed putting my kid up on my shoulders or something. It took me too long to do anything about it. I found [Certain Dri](https://www.amazon.com/Certain-Dri-Anti-Perspirant-Prescription-Protection/dp/B01JB1MUNI/?). There are lots of similar products, but this is what was available at Walmart. Maybe surprisingly, it worked for me. I started putting it on nightly before bed. Within a couple days, my armpits were dry throughout the day. My confidence levels increased like 10x. Now, I put it on maybe once or twice a week.
