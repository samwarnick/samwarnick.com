There's been a little chatter about slash pages, so figured I'd post about mine.

*   [/about](https://samwarnick.com/about/)
    *   I probably shouldn't even have this page cause I'm just a boring person. But I've seen some cool ones that have different length about depending on how much time you have. Maybe I should put some love into this page.
*   [/blogroll](https://samwarnick.com/blogroll/)
    *   Think I'm missing someone? LMK.
*   [/ideas](https://samwarnick.com/ideas/)
    *   I update this every once in a while. Just apps I'm thinking about or other ideas.
*   [/now](https://samwarnick.com/now/)
    *   Part /about and part what am I doing. Updated every month or two. (Don't look at the commit history to check me on that.)
*   [/site](https://samwarnick.com/site/)
    *   Just a bit about what makes this site work. Fairly stable.
*   [/uses](https://samwarnick.com/uses/)
    *   Kinda just a list of my favorite things. My favorites don't change too often, but I update this as I think of things.

Overall, the basic stuff you'd probably expect. If you looked at my [/ideas](https://samwarnick.com/ideas/), you'd see that one idea is a little app that can easily update some of these pages.

Any slash pages you think I should add?
