I spent some time moving from PicoCSS to my "own" designs. It's still rough, but I'm liking the direction. I stole a little from Stripe, a little from Apple, jumped on the [Atkinson Hyperlegible Next](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/#download) and [Uchu colors](https://uchu.style/). It's getting there.

Alright, time for some screenshots.

The main view—and the whole point of my app—shows a single to-do. The idea is you select what you want to work on, and see whatever you put at the top of your list. Complete that, and the next will be shown. Pretty simple.

There's going to be quite a bit of functionality hidden away on the All Todos page for a list. Right now you can reorder, toggle completion, and add new tasks. The frosted glass look brought to you by [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/backdrop-filter/).

So far, I'm still sticking to HTMX. I'm using [SortableJS](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/) for reordering, but I'm not totally happy with it. It feels a little clunky, and things break a bit when it tries to autoscroll for you. I need to look into other options. I've got a long list of features to work on, and I'm a little nervous that it will be annoying to get HTMX and AlpineJS—or pure JS—to do what I want and I'll just fall back to a JS framework like Svelte. But I’m going to keep pushing forward. I want to build something using techniques I'm not familiar with.
