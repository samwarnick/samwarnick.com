  I spent the week implementing todo reordering in my app, following HTMX
  examples and tackling some database challenges.

This last week was spent implementing todo reordering. While the main view only shows you a single app, there is a "backend" page that shows you all tasks. I want to be able to reorder this easily. I basically just followed the [HTMX Sortable](https://htmx.org/examples/sortable/) example. Mine is a little more simplified:

```js
htmx.onLoad(() => {
	const list = document.getElementById('pendingTodos');
	if (list) {
		const sortableInstance = new Sortable(list, {
			animation: 150,
			ghostClass: 'sortable-ghost',
			chosenClass: 'sortable-chosen',
			dragClass: 'sortable-drag',

			// Disable sorting on the `end` event
			onEnd: function (evt) {
				this.option('disabled', true);
			},
		});

		list.addEventListener('htmx:afterSwap', function () {
			sortableInstance.option('disabled', false);
		});
	}
});
```

I load this script when you land on the todos page. When Sortable emits an `end` event, that triggers the request to save the reorder. I use `hx-include` to include the hidden value of the todo ID in the request. This is sent to the backend as an array of IDs in the expected order.

```jsx
<div
	hx-post={`/app/list/${list?.id}/todos/reorder`}
	hx-trigger="end"
	hx-include="#pendingTodos [name='id']"
>
	<GroupedTodoList todos={list?.todos ?? []} />
</div>
```

Perhaps naively, I take that array and just brute force update every todo. I don't try and get fancy and only update the todos that are affected by a move. I'm sure there are better ways. I found a [Drizzle ORM guide](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/guides/update-many-with-different-value) on making multiple updates at once. I get what it's doing, but I wonder if there is a more efficient way.

```ts
const sqlChunks: SQL[] = [];
sqlChunks.push(sql`(case`);
ids.forEach((id, i) => {
	sqlChunks.push(sql`when ${todos.id} = ${id} then ${i + 1}`);
	ids.push(id);
});
sqlChunks.push(sql`end)`);
const finalSql: SQL = sql.join(sqlChunks, sql.raw(' '));
console.log(finalSql);
await db
	.update(todos)
	.set({ position: finalSql })
	.where(inArray(todos.id, ids));
```

Right now, I don't allow ordering of completed todos. So I need to figure out how to handle position in that case. Possibly clearing out `position` when a todo is marked completed. Or making separate queries for pending and completed todos so I can order them differently. Not sure yet.

I also want to handle reordering multiple todos at once. This will require some thought though. Eventually, I want inline editing and some menu options on each todo and I don't want that to interfere with selection and reordering. I may need to reconsider some things.

Still no screenshots. I'm just using Pico CSS and I'm not happy with how it looks. I might spend some time this coming week to play with some design ideas of my own.
