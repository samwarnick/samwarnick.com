Here's some things on my list.

*   Web version of [ScreenCred](https://screencred.app)
*   Update ScreenCred for iOS 26/Liquid Glass
    *   Even do this? Move to web only?
    *   It's fun working on it though. Rethinking things.
*   Improve [/pokemon](https://samwarnick.com/pokemon)
    *   Filtering
    *   Better categories
*   Reseal the living room windows
*   Organize office closet
*   Order pieces for summer trees in the Lego city
*   Web version of my "what's for dinner?" app
    *   Generate it's own calendar instead of using an existing shared calendar
*   Reconsider my self-hosting strategy
    *   Most things could be Cloudflare workers?
    *   How to handle media?
*   Organize Pokemon cards
*   Redesign site
*   Make new site?

I'm sure I'm missing things. This is what immediately came to mind.
