It's summer. WWDC is over. Time to get to work.

While I still have [mixed](https://samwarnick.com/blog/to-be-native-or-not/) [feelings](https://samwarnick.com/blog/to-native-or-not-part-ii/) about developing for Apple platforms, I enjoy it. After WWDC I feel invigorated and excited to work on things. I guess that's part of the point? This year, [Liquid Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Glass) was announced. A fantastic opportunity for me to rethink the design of my app [ScreenCred](https://screencred.app).

I've been working on it for a couple weeks and thought I'd share a sneak peak. New designs are on the left and current designs are on the right.

The left screen shows a grid of movie poster thumbnails, while the right screen displays a search bar and a list of movie suggestions. The app appears to be a platform for discovering and accessing various movies and TV shows.](https://samwarnick.com/media/2025-06-22-screencred-1.png)

The image does not contain any human faces, so I will not attempt to identify or name any individuals.](https://samwarnick.com/media/2025-06-22-screencred-2.png)

With ScreenCred, I've always struggled to utilize all the space effectively. I think utilizing horizontal scroll sections similar to the Music app help a lot. I like encapsulating 2 movie posters in a square. I think it links them together much more strongly. I'm not 100% sure about dropping the titlesâ€”letting that simmer a bit.

I still like a lot from the existing designs. My goal was to do something different. But I think that goal distracted me from getting other fundamentals right. So I'm having fun stripping things back and rethinking it all. Like bringing the recents/history right onto the main view instead of hidden behind a menu. I'm utilizing more navigation stacks which I think feel more familiar. But I like the chunky black outlines and I might keep those.

There is still _a lot_ to figure out, but I'm liking this direction quite a bit. I was especially inspired by a session from this year called "Design foundations from idea to interface". If you watch it, I think you'll see where a lot of my ideas come from lol.
