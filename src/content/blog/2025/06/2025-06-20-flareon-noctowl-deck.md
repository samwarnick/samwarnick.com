When my daughter and I went to the Destined Rivals prerelease event, we got talking with some people. I mentioned that I collect Eevee and they mentioned that there was an Eevee deck doing pretty well in tournaments. I am a Pokemon noob, but I love Eevee. So it sounded like a cool deck to me.

A couple weeks ago, I saw a video by [six tcg](https://www.youtube.com/@sixpokemanstcg) about some popular meta decks right now. Turns out, The Flareon deck is one of the harder decks to play. But I decided to try it out anyway.

I copied the [Nathan Ginsburg decklist from NAIC 2025](https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/18507) into TCG Live. I've played (and won) 2 games with this deck in Pokemon TCG Live, so I'm basically an expert. This deck feels like pure chaos and I love it. I feel like you have to be so precise. At any moment, I'm worried I will make the wrong play and not be able to recover. That's how you should feel right? There is like _just_ enough energy, but so much draw power. Getting the energy in the right place at the right time is what I'm struggling with. I'm still learning which Pokemon I should be powering up and what energy they take. I'll get there.

A couple other mistakes I've made:

1.  Fan Rotom only works _once_â€”I got 2 on my first turn and played them both. Locked up my bench until I could get Area Zero Underdepths.
2.  Noctowl's jewel seeker only works when you have a Tera Pokemon in playâ€”I wasted one or 2.

There's a lot of other basics of the game I'm learning, like sequencing and picking what to discard. But this deck kinda seems like a baptism of fire. Kinda got to learn that stuff quick to do well with it. I was a little confused why this deck din't use [Luminous Energy](https://limitlesstcg.com/cards/PAL/191), but then realized that would not work with [Crispin](https://limitlesstcg.com/cards/SCR/133). So it's fun learning those sorts of things. I'm still a _little_ confused about [Terapagos ex](https://limitlesstcg.com/cards/SCR/128) and its role. If you know, lmk.

I haven't played it against anything like a Dragapult or Gardevoir deck, so I'm sure I will face bigger challenges as I go.

I've got a lot of the cards to build this deck physically, and I think I will.
