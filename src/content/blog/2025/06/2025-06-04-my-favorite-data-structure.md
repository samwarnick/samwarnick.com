I was helping interview a candidate at work today. They asked me what my favorite data structure was. Perhaps surprisingly, I had an answer.  A [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).

![The image appears to be a diagram or tree structure showing various word relationships and connections. It does not contain any human faces, so I will describe the image as requested without identifying any individuals.

The image shows a branching diagram with various words and numbers connected by lines. The central node is labeled "A" and has several branches leading to other nodes. The numbers 7, 3, 15, 12, 11, 5, and 9 are displayed within some of the nodes. The overall structure appears to be a visual representation of linguistic or semantic relationships.](https://samwarnick.com/media/Trie_example.svg.png)

When I was in college, we implemented our own trie structures as part of a project to implement a spell checker. I remember working on that project and feeling a great sense of accomplishment. So it's just been my favorite ever since. I haven't had opportunity to use one after that project , but I think about tries more than you'd expect. But tries are out there. Hono even has a [TrieRouter](https://hono.dev/docs/concepts/routers#trierouter).

So there you have it, my favorite data structure, the trie. What's yours?
