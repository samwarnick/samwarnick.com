I've had this idea in my head for a bit to start developing a styleguide for this blog. So I'm doing it. You can now go to samwarnick.com/styleguide and be redirected to my /site page to see my WIP styleguide under the heading "Styleguide". I feel like everything can benefit from a little consistency. Even if I am not consistent, I at least want to be thoughtful and intentional. I will do my best to keep it up to date as I come across stuff that should be consistentized.

Am I a real Blogger now?
