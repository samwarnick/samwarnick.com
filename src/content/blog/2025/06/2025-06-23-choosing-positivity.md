This will probably start sounding pretty negative, but I'm hoping it will turn around by the end.

After Apple [rejected Hannah's Game](https://samwarnick.com/blog/to-native-or-not-part-ii/), I was feeling pretty grumpy\[^1\]. Soon after, I kinda just stopped posting on and using Mastodon, becoming a bit of a digital recluse. WWDC came around and I logged in to see what the scuttlebutt was. Whether true or not, things just felt negative to me. Not just about WWDC, but kinda everything? I'm a pessimist and grump by nature, but it's pretty exhausting when everyone else is too. I need some balance.

I need to be better. I want to be better. Maybe I've naturally gravitated towards following other grumps. I need to be better at finding people less grumpy than me and stop following the others.

[Dave is a good example](https://catskull.net/your-ideas-deserve-to-be-shared.html) of an optimistic and all around positive person.

> I’ve never met someone I didn’t like. I’ve met people that were doing things I didn’t like and I didn’t get much insight into the rest of their behaviors. I’ve always found a lot to like about anyone. The worst coworker I’ve ever was also incredibly talented at volleyball and an extremely dedicated father.

I like that sentiment. We can still be enthusiastic and positive while pushing and driving change. Not all change comes from being overly critical and negative. I want my blog and myself to be a source of positivity. I can't promise I'll be good at it—it does not come naturally to me. As always, there are exceptions to the rule. But I'm hoping I can keep the exceptions as close to zero as possible.

How did this end up?
