Like I said in [Wrapping Up the Year of Groundwork](/2021/1/wrapping-up-the-year-of-groundwork), after 2020, I don't feel like I have much gas left in the tank. That's why I've decided to make 2021 the Year of Momentum. I want to keep going on the good things I started in 2020. I'm still figuring out what that means exactly, but hereâ€™s where Iâ€™m currently at:

-   My wife and I are trying to finish our house in the next few weeks. We have been living with my in-laws for over a year now. Much longer than planned.
-   A few weeks after weâ€™re planning on moving into our house, we are expecting a new baby.

In short, itâ€™s going to take a lot for me to barely make it through this winter, hence the Season of Survival. The next few months are going to be about managing stress and anxiety. So unless I think it will be helpful, Iâ€™m not going to start anything new. [Focuses](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focuses/id1492385864#?platform=iphone) will probably be on the back burner until Spring (though there are a couple bug fixes I should probably get out soon ðŸ¤”.) I might even need to pull back on the amount of time Iâ€™ve been freelancing. There's a lot that needs to be done, and I need to figure out how to get it all done without collapsing on myself like a dying star.

So 2021, keep going and try not to crash.
