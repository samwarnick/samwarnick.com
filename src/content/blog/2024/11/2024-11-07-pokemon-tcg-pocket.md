Pokemon Pocket is the newest mobile Pokemon game. I've been enjoying it. It's fun to collect cards—yes, even though they are just pixels on a screen and entries in a database—and the quick battles fit well into my life. As I was looking through which cards I still needed to complete the initial Genetic Apex expansion, I got thinking, how much would it cost to just buy a missing card?

In the physical Pokemon TCG, you can get cards by opening booster packs or buying singles from sellers online. Opening packs is fun, but buying singles is typically far more economical.

A near-mint [Charizard EX from the Obsidian Flames](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/509879/pokemon-sv03-obsidian-flames-charizard-ex-125-197?Language=English&page=1) expansion is currently going for about $3 on TCGplayer.

In Pocket, you can get cards by opening packs or spending pack points to "craft" a card. Every pack you open gives you 5 Pack Points. The problem is, you can't just buy Pack Points. You _only_ get them through opening packs. But you can put Poke Gold to open packs. Complicated enough?

The Charizard EX costs 500 Pack Points to craft. That's 100 packs. With the 2 free packs a day, it will take 50 days to save all that up. If you pay $10 a month for the premium pass, you get an extra pack a day, so a little more than a month to save up 500 Pack Points. Alternatively, you can buy Poke Gold and use 6 Poke Gold to open a pack. The most cost-effective bundle of Poke Gold is $99.99 for 690 Poke Gold, which is enough to open 115 packs. 87 cents per pack. So that 500 Pack Point card in dollars? **$87.00**. A common card is about $1. The rarest cards that cost 2,500 Pack Points will be about $435.

Those are some expensive pixels.

But maybe you'll just pull the card as you're ripping those digital packs to get those Pack Points!

I'll stick to buying expensive paper cards instead. I'm still planning on playing Pocket though.
