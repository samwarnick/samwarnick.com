No step of building LEGO is irreversibleâ€”except maybe stickers ðŸ¤«. A set can be completely deconstructed and its pieces reused countless times. This makes it really cheap to iterate on ideas. Instead of having to buy new materials and start from scratch each time you have a new idea, you can build off of what you already have. But, you still have the option of starting over if you want! Which is really incredibleâ€”the more you can iterate and try ideas, the quicker you can learn and level up.

Just the other day, I wanted to try a different line color on the roads in my city. It took me about 15 mins to swap out the colors and decide I liked it better. If I didn't like it better, would've take another 15 mins to change it back. There are not many things where it feels so cheap to try ideas, and I love it.
