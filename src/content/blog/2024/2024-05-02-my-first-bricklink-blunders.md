In my hubris, I assumed that since my store was so small, I would not make mistakes like I've seen other sellers make on YouTube and elsewhere. Turns out, even though my store is small, I'm still an idiot human who makes mistakes.

I recently when through a big consolidation effort. I combined multiple lots together in drawers to free up space for more lots.While going through all that, I found a few lots that were in the wrong place! Like more than one. Some were simple mistypes (e.g., 114 instead of 141,) but others I have no explanation.

I fixed them as I went, but I'm a little scared I may have created more ðŸ˜¬.

I've only had like 5 orders (I'm a big time seller.) The last one was my biggestâ€”15 minifigs. Turns out, I included 3 extra minifigs! Not insignificant minifigs either. I didn't read the order carefully enough. The buyer contacted me about the mistake and offered to pay me for them, but I told them to not worry about itâ€”my mistake after all.

It just goes to show that mistakes happen at all scales!
