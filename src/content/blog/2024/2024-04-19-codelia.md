[Codelia](https://tosche.net/fonts/codelia) by Yoshi Omagari is hands down my favorite monospace font. I use it in all my editors and made a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com) version for my terminal. I found Codelia because I came across [Comic Code](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code). I was looking for something different, and less boring. I was real close to buying Comic Code when I saw Codelia. I love that Codelia has some of the roundness and softness of Comic Code, but still looks "professional." It has character, and that character actually helps me read my code.

If I could afford a license to use on my website, I would. Instead, I use [Comic Mono](https://dtinth.github.io/comic-mono-font/) here. If you're looking for something free and different, check out Comic Mono.
