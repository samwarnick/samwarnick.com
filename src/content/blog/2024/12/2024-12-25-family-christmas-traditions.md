## Christmas Eve

Christmas Eve was usually the day we decorated the Christmas tree. Some years, it was also the day we brought the tree into the house. For many years, my parents would get a live tree. By live tree, I mean a tree that still had a big, heavy root ball. We'd later dig a hole somewhere in the yard and plant it.

As long as I can remember, my dad has always been in charge of Christmas Eve dinner. He lived in Germany for a couple of years, and one of the things he brought back with him is _Abendbrot_.  In Germany, this is just a light evening meal. For us, it meant getting meats, cheeses, and bread from the German deli (when possible). We'd also have rosehip tea, chocolates, and other sides.

After dinner, we'd have a family talent show. After about age 6, my go-to talent was standing on my head. We'd read Christmas stories too.

After the talent show, we'd all get a sock. Usually a large hiking sock and place it on a chair or spot on the couch. This is how Santa would know where to leave presents for each of us.

The tree area would then be blocked off with chairs in an attempt to obstruct early risers. Then it was time for bed.

## Christmas

Us kids would wake up and try to wake our parents up as early as we thought we could get away with it. Maybe around 6? It got later and later as we got older. We’d try to inspect what Santa brought us. Flashlights out, we'd peer through the barricade. If we were feeling especially adventurous, we might even cross the boundary and get up close—don't tell. But we wouldn't open anything yet.

Breakfast had to be prepared and eaten before presents could be opened. To help speed things along, it became the kids' responsibility to make breakfast. Usually toast, bagels, and sausage. Sometimes fried eggs. This took forever.

You might think we could now run in and open presents after waiting so patiently, but no. We then had to get in line and march around the house to inspect each room. This came from my mom's family.

The living room was the last stop on the march. We could all open our socks, where we usually found candy and small presents, like batteries.

The anticipation would really be building by now. If no one had thrown up from excitement by this point, we'd begin taking turns opening presents—one at a time. Usually, we started with the youngest child—me. Santa wrapped all the presents he left. Sometimes, Sanity Clause would leave us presents too. We'd (not so) patiently watch each person unwrap their present, and we'd all ooh and aah. If Grandma was there, we'd have to wait for her to carefully fold her wrapping paper up. After we opened all of Santa's presents, we'd open presents from family. Again, taking turns. Once it was all over, someone would say, “Nothing left but the crying."

The rest of the morning and afternoon was filled with building new LEGO sets, naps, eating, etc.

Christmas dinner varied over the years. Ham, turkey, or clam chowder were the most common. And rolls. My mom makes the best rolls.

That's about it. I like a lot of the traditions my family had growing up. My wife and I have incorporated some of them into our family. We don't make our kids make us breakfast, but I do make them march around the house and we take turns unwrapping presents. Some years we use big socks, but others we'll use traditional stockings. We don't wait until Christmas Eve to decorate the tree.
