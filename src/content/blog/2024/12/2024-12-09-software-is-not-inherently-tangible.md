I've been watching a lot of studio tours lately. Designers and artists showing off their incredible and inspiring workspaces doesn't exactly make me depressed, but they do give me the sense that I'm missing out on something. Something tangible.

I mostly make websites and apps. I don't write software for robots or machines or anything you would actually interact with. I make stuff to look at on your phone. You can't exactly hold a website. They don't take up space in the real world. Sometimes it gets old just sitting at my computer writing code all day, especially when nothing physical comes from it. It's neat seeing it on your phone or the App Store. But then it's gone.

It makes me want something to be a placeholder for my apps and sites in the real world. Something to remind me that I've built something. I've seen devs get nice glass prints of their app icons. One dev even got beautiful software boxes designed and printed for their iOS apps. I've thought maybe floppy disks or SD cards with custom labels would be niceâ€”could even put something related to the app or site on them. Maybe melt all the soda cans I drink while making something down into an aluminum cube. Something. I haven't figured it out yet.
