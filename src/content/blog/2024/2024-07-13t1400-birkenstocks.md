I love factory videos and YouTube knows it. The Youtubes recently fed me this Birkenstocks video. It was an interesting look into the process. I have a strong affinty for my Birkenstocks. I've had them for nearly 20 years. My daughter has grown up thinking only cool people wear Birkenstocks with socks. But I was worried they wouldn't last. The soles started to crack and disintegrate through wear and tear and negligence on my part. Last year, my wife sent them off to be repaired. One of the best gifts I've gotten. I love that it's even possible. I'm excited to have them for another 20 years, and more after that.
