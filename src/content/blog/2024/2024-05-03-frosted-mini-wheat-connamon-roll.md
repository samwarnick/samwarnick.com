I love cinnamon rolls. Despite always being disappointed by cinnamon roll flavored things, I decided to give these a shot. Yet again, another miss.

These are just cinnamon flavored. A cinnamon  roll is more than cinnamon. It's a perfect blend of brown sugar, vanilla, cream cheese, and cinnamon. I think they assumed the existing frosting on the mini wheat would cover their bases. They were wrong.

Though not close to a cinnamon roll flavor, they still tasted fine. Too much cinnamon for my taste, but not the end of the world.

I would rate original Frosted Mini Wheats at 4/5. This cinnamon roll variant is worse. 3/5.
