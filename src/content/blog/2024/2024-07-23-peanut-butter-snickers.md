These are the best Snickers. Better than the originals. Unfortunately, they are increasingly difficult to findâ€”my local grocery stores no longer carry them. I started getting nervous that they were done for. [Snickers said on Twitter](https://x.com/SNICKERS/status/1656375450820661254), "although Peanut Butter SNICKERS are a bit harder to find, they are not discontinued." I actually logged in to find this tweet. You're welcome.

Any way, over a year later, still hard to find. Luckily, my wife found the above pictured Peanut Butter Snickers at Dollar General. [Snickers online locator](https://www.snickers.com/where-to-buy?ps-sku=040000441489) also claims Circle K has them. I will check that out.

All I can say is, I hope they are around forever and ever.
