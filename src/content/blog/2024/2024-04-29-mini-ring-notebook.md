While I've always like the idea of pocket notebooks like Field Notes, they never really clicked with me. Probably user error, but I have a hard time writing in pocket notebooks. The spines are so stiff, that it takes effort to keep them open while writing in them. As an alternative, I started using some [imported index cards](https://www.amazon.com/Exacompta-Index-Cards-Inch-100Pk/dp/B001AO138S?th=1) instead, and loved it. But then they'd get flipped upside down or shuffled and I'd get lost.

[Enter the Life Noble Mini Ring notebook](https://www.jetpens.com/Life-Noble-Notebook-Mini-Ring-5-x-3.1-Plain/pd/20212). I just received another restock of these today, so figured it was the right time to write about these.

The JetPens description sums up why I love them so much:

> This mini-sized notebook is perfect for carrying in a purse or pocket. Its twin-ring binding lets you fold the pages back completely and to tear out individual pages when you need to.

## Pros

- The paper is pretty great. I've used pencil, gel, fountain pens, and fineliners. Handles them all great.
- Size is perfect—it fits perfectly in my front shirt pocket.
- Can just tear paper out. Since it's ring bound, ripping a paper out won't ruin the binding.
- They stay open. Plus, open all the way to easily hold in one hand. Small and compact, all the time.
- Cream-colored paper. Might be a con for some, but white paper feels so bright to me. Cream-colored paper feels soft and friendly—character.

## Cons

- I worry about the rings scratching things if I throw it in a bag.
- Expensive. $5 each is not cheap. Worth it for me, but not everyone.

This is not my only notebook, but it might be the most important because it's where a lot of ideas start.
