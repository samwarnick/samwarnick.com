I didn't get any orders for over a month. There are lots of explanations for this, but one possible one, in my mind, was not offering PayPal as a payment option.

I initially only setup Stripe. I've used it before in other contexts and was more familiar with it. I like its interface and transparent/simple fees. I've also heard nothing but bad things from friends who have used PayPal for businesses. So I wanted to stay away.

Thinking there could maybe be something wrong with Stripe and *that's* why I wasn't getting orders, I setup PayPal. Or at least attempted to. It was kinda confusing. I still have no idea if I have micro transactions enabled or what fees I would pay. But I got it enabled on BrickLink.

The next order I got used Stripe. So I knew it was still working. I almost immediately turned off PayPal after that. I still have the account as a backup, but I would much prefer to be Stripe only. Maybe it's a mistake and I should offer both, but I like the simplicity of having one payment option. It at least makes my spreadsheet simpler.
