Looking at my 5 orders (again, I'm a big time seller,) it's obvious that minifigs are what sell. I don't think that's news to anyone.

With around 15,000 parts in my store, I just don't have the large quantities or variety that attracts those kinds of buyers. So it has me thinking about what I should do moving forward.

Minifigs sell well and are typically higher value. This means they are expensive to acquire though.

The 2 options I see are:

1. Gamble on bulk minifig lots.
2. Keep buying and parting out sets, but only sell the minifigs.

Or I guess 3â€”both.

Shifting to be minifig heavy in my store could have some advantages. They may be easier to store. And if I keep the other pieces for myself, that would be nice for MOCs.

Just some thoughts I'm mulling over.
