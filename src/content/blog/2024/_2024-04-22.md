I think I'm a pretty good employee.

![Footage not found](/media/2024-04-22-footage-not-found.jpg "ðŸ˜¬")

But I don't like being an employee. You might say the obvious answer is to work for myself. _But_, do you ever truly work for yourself? You're either working for your boss, shareholders, clients, or customers.

If I could, I would just mess around and make stuff for myself. But I don't pay well, and my family requires money to survive. Like I don't even mean make something for myself but secretly hope thousands of people will buy it and support me. When people start using my stuff, I freak out. I just want to selfishly make things for myself.

If you want to work on something slowly, what you produce has to be pretty great to make it worth all that time. My problem is that I'm not particularly smart or clever. I'm probably not going to invent something novel. I'm probably not even going to combine other people's inventions into something unique.

I just want to make things with no accountability. Is that too much to ask for? Maybe I just haven't found the right motivations. Right now my main motivation is making money to take care of my family. That's enough for a lot of people. Maybe that should be enough for me too.

Maybe I'm just too selfish.

How do I do what I want?

Step 1 is probably to figure out what I want.

I don't know what I want to do and I'm in a difficult position to figure that out.
