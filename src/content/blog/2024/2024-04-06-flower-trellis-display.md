This set was really fun for me. It was fun because some of the pieces really surprised me, and the way it turned out at the end looked great. Some of the pieces that surprised me were: How they used the 1x2 pink slope for part of the flower petals, and the yellowish orange eggs for buds. How they set up the vine system was also cool to me. I also really liked the basket design for the bottom trough. All-in-all, the set  was really cool to me.
