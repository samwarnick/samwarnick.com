At the start of 2024, I decided it was going to be the year of LEGO for me. I wouldn’t describe it as a mid-life crisis, but maybe close to it. I embarked on 2 endeavors—building a small LEGO city and starting a small BrickLink store.

I started my city with one modular building, the [Detective’s Office](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/detective-s-office-10246). I bought this set back in 2015 and it’s been pretty lonely ever since. I ordered a bunch of pieces on BrickLink to build some roads to go around it. Pretty soon, the [Bookshop](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/bookshop-10270) and [Natural History Museum](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/natural-history-museum-10326) joined. This is about where I am today. I’m mostly limited on space at the moment. Everything is sitting on a workbench in my office.

Since I had already pretty much gone insane, and those cool Akro-Mils drawers would fit perfectly in my closet, I thought why not start a BrickLink store too? It’s the year of LEGO after all. Too much money later, [that’s exactly what I did](https://store.bricklink.com/samwarnick&amp;utm_content=globalnav#/shop). Opened up February 15, 2024.

I started posting things on Instagram as a way to share what I’m doing, but also to hold myself a little accountable to actually keep going. For various reasons, I decided I want my primary outlet to be something I own. So here I am now, blogging about LEGO. No clue what I’m doing, so follow along!
