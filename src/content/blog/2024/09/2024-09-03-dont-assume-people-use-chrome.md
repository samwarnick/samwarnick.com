  I share my frustrations with browser compatibility in 2024 and why it's
  important to develop for multiple browsers.

IMO, all browsers have one or more fatal flaws that make them bad. I've yet to find a browser that I'd call excellent. Safari is my browser of choice. I like that it's not owned by Google and it mostly works. Things are pretty good, but I'm still surprised at how often I come across a site that doesn't really work in Safari.

As my daughter and I have been getting more into Pokémon, I've used a couple tools that don't download or print images correctly in Safari. Open them in Chrome, and they magically work.

At work, we are using a new testing tool that straight up says "you have to use Chrome" on the login page. Can't even login using Safari. In 2024, I thought we were over that.

I like the web because it's supposed to be open and portable. But that falls apart when you develop sites that only work in Chrome. I get that there are some APIs that Safari doesn't implement and probably won't—some for privacy reasons, others for platform control? So I think it's totally valid for some specialized apps that need certain APIs to have limited support in other browsers. But make it clear why those are needed. When making a site or app, probably don't assume everyone uses Chrome just because you do.
