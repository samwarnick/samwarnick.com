I was reading [Dave's post on index card journaling](https://catskull.net/index-card-journaling.html)  the other day. In it is a YouTube video.

The TL;DR of this video is put labels on things. But, also in it, are labels with QR codes. This got my brain excited.

For a while now, I've been collecting digital versions of manuals of important things like my chainsaw, the fridge, etc. But I never had a great way of accessing them. This video connected some dots for me. I need to create QR codes that I can put directly on appliances, tools, etc. that will take me to the manuals, notes, or whatever.

Time to make an app.

To keep things simple, I created a new folder in Google Drive called "Home Database" with folders like "Kitchen" and "Garage". I shared this with my wife and put what I have so far up there.

Part 2 is an app that will generate short links and QR codes. I make a new link called "Chainsaw" or whatever, and tell it to redirect to my chainsaw folder in Google Drive. It generates a short link like `qr.warnick.me/123abc`. This way, I can change what the short link is pointing to without needing a new QR code.

What I still need to work out is how to print the QR codes. I'm currently looking at the [Brother PTD610BT](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/ptd610bt). It has software to let it print QR codes. I've read that Brother labels are a little more durable than Dymo labels.

Alternatively, I could buy sheets of vinyl address labels or something like that. I still like the idea of the Brother better because it's easier to just print one label if needed.

I told my wife about my plan and she got really excited. We share the love-of-organization gene.

We'll see how it goes!
