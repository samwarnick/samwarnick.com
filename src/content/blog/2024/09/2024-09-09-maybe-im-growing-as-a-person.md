The iPhone event happened today. For the first time in a long time, I feel nearly no desire to buy any of the products they announced.

I have the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It's really good. Screen is fantastic. Photos and video are pretty good most of the time. Battery is usually more than enough. The volume button or action button can take a photo.

I have the Apple Watch Series 8. It's also really good. I can go for longer 2+ hour runs, listening to podcasts and still have battery when I'm done.

I'm content with what I have and it's a nice feeling. Maybe this says more about what was announced than it does about me, but I like to think that I am growing as a person.
