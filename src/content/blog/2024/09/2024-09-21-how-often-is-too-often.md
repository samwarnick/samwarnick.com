title: How Often Is Too Often

  I'm feeling lazy, so I'm publishing a bunch of blog posts all at once instead
  of scheduling them.

Sometimes I just get a lot of ideas of things I want to blog about all at the same time. That's why I built in scheduling to my Eleventy setup.

But I'm feeling lazy today, so everything is getting published immediately.

Makes me wonder, on a blog like mine, is there such a thing as too often? I'm thinking not. But I guess the gang in the Discord will let me know when the bot spams with a bunch of new posts.
