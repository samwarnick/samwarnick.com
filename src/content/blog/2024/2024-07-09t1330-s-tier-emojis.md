Here are 5 emoji that immediately came to mind when I thought "S-tier emoji":

- 🫠
  - Recent addition that just captures so much. Chef's kiss.
- 😏
  - It's sly. It's flirty. It's up to something.
- 🤷🏻‍♂️
  - It kinda looks like me and it's better than saying "IDK" or "Pizza?"
- 🤦🏻‍♂️
  - It's just how I feel a lot of the time.
- 😬
  - Fits in a lot of contexts and I can't think of English words to replace it.
