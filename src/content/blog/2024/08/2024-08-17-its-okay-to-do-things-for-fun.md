My daughter and I have started collecting Pokémon cards. We're having fun! My collection is quite still small, but I've pulled a couple rare cards. I texted a family member to show them, and he showed a friend. The friend was like "you have to get that graded and sold ASAP—the value will probably drop soon." Gotta make that quick buck right? I responded that I'm just collecting to collect. You know, for fun.

Here's the thing, it's okay to do things for fun. Everything doesn't have to be taken so seriously. You don't have to look at everything you do as an investment. You can collect and keep things just because you like them. Let others do the same.
