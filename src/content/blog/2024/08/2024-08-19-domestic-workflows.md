[ATP recently had a member's special](https://atp.fm/atp-insider-domestic-workflows) where they talked about "domestic workflows", or things they do that make day-to-day life at home easier. Interesting to think about.

Here's mine:

> Have multiple sets of measuring cups and spoons.

Growing up, I feel like we had a 2 measuring cupsâ€”one for dry and for liquids. When big cooking and baking days came, there was a lot of washing just to get things made.

I didn't like that and vowed it would be different in my house.

My wife and I now have 3 sets of measuring cups and 3 sets of measuring spoons. This helps us stay in the flow when baking and cooking. Just makes things easier. It's just a better way.

Along with that, we bought our kids cheap ones to play with so they don't steal ours.

Bonus domestic workflow:

> Have a bunch of cheap tasting spoons so you don't use your eating spoons for cooking.
