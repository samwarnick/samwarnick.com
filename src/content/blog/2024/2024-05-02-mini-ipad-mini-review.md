Not going to lie, comparing it to an iPhone 15 Pro Max is not favorable to the iPad mini. The screen doesn't look as nice as the OLED and feels slow. And I _definitely_ notice the jelly scrolling.

Despite the lackluster screen, it is pretty great.

I enjoy having a slightly bigger screen for watching things. I think the mini size is much better for casual activities than the 11" I had before.

There are rumors of a refresh in the fall, but pretty much just a spec bump that may fix jelly scrolling. I'm not terribly worried that I bought close to the end of this generation's life. For what I'm using it for, it's pretty good.

4 out of 5.

LMK when there's an OLED version though.
