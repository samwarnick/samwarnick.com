As part of my efforts to improve accessibility in ScreenCred, I've been working at improving layouts for large Dynamic Type sizes. To help with this, I'm trying to use `ViewThatFits`. It works as I'd expect in most places. However, I had a lot of issues when trying to use it within a ScrollView for repeating items. I'm sure that a lot of my issues are from not really knowing how `ViewThatFits` chooses which view to use. What is "fits"? I'm not 100% sure.

In ScreenCreds, I have a couple places with lists and I want every item in that list to either be a horizontal layout or a vertical layout, but not a mix of both.

On an individual view, ViewThatFits works real well:

```swift
ViewThatFits {
	HStack {
		Image(item.image)
		Text(item.label)
	}
	VStack {
		Image(item.image)
		Text(item.label)
	}
}
```

If the text gets too long, it will switch to use the VStack View. But, if I put that in a ForEach, which view that fits is dependent on the content, so some items may use HStack and others will VStack. Not what I want.

```swift
ScrollView {
	ForEach(item) { item in
		ViewThatFits {
			HStack {
				Image(item.image)
				Text(item.label)
			}
			VStack {
				Image(item.image)
				Text(item.label)
			}
		}
	}
}
```

So I thought, easy, just put two ForEaches:

```swift
ScrollView {
	ViewThatFits {
		ForEach(item) { item in
			HStack {
				Image(item.image)
				Text(item.label)
			}
		}
		ForEach(item) { item in
			VStack {
				Image(item.image)
				Text(item.label)
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Unfortunately, this did not work. No matter what I tried, it always picked the second View. The only way I found to fix this is to switch between ScrollViews:

```swift
ViewThatFits
	ScrollView {
		ForEach(item) { item in
			HStack {
				Image(item.image)
				Text(item.label)
			}
		}
	}
	ScrollView {
		ForEach(item) { item in
			VStack {
				Image(item.image)
				Text(item.label)
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The way my views are constructed, it wasn't as simple as this. It would've been tricky to refactor things to work like this. So I came up with a solution to use an Environment value.

```swift
enum Layout {
    case horizontal, vertical
}

private struct LayoutKey: EnvironmentKey {
    static let defaultValue = Layout.horizontal
}

extension EnvironmentValues {
    var layout: Layout {
    get { self[LayoutKey.self] }
    set { self[LayoutKey.self] = newValue }
  }
}

ViewThatFits {
	Main()
		.environment(\.layout, .horizontal)
	Main()
		.environment(\.layout, .vertical)
}
```

In this case, the ScrollView is a few views deep in `Main`. Each repeated item is a few views deeper. But, at the point I need to decide which layout to use, I can grab my layout Environment value.

So far, this seems to work the way I want! I'm not totally sure if this is performant or not.

I was really glad I was able to get ViewThatFits to work. The only other alternative was changing layouts at some arbitrary `sizeCategory`. That would be gross because it would depend on screen size and all that.

SO hopefully this will continue to work well. I should probably rewatch [the WWDC video](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/10056) about ViewThatFits.

P.S. In places I couldn't use the Xcode Previews, I've been using [Sim Genie](https://simgenie.app) to easily change Dynamic Type in the simulator. Fantastic app.
