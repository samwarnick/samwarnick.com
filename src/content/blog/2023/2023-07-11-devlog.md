I knew I had seen. Feature in Swift strings that could automatically pluralize words depending on a value. Took me a while to find the actual thing I wanted. Turns out it's called morphology. [Jordan Morgan has a great post about it](https://www.swiftjectivec.com/morphology-in-ios-with-automatic-grammar-agreement/).

It works nicely when using `Text` in SwiftUI:

```swift
Text("Last compared \(timestamp.formatted()) and seen ^[\(historyItems.count) time](inflect: true)")
```

It's not the nicest syntax, but better than doing it all myself.
