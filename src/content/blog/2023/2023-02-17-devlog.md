Got too many things going on right now. Trying to do some redesigns to ScreenCred, but not feeling very inspired. So thought I'd switch to trying and making my own node server to generate the `og:image`. Netlify has been taking like 10 seconds, which is not great. I think what I came up with should run around ~600ms. Which is still not as fast as I would like, but better than 10 seconds! I'm trying to deploy it to [fly.io](https://fly.io), but that relies pretty heavily on Docker, and I am not even a novice when it comes to Docker. So maybe I should just run in on my Linode. IDK.
