I'm starting on iPad support for ScreenCred. It may not be quite as difficult as I originally thought. It doesn't look too bad out of the box, but it just feels like a giant iPhone app. That might be fine for now. It's pretty simple, so not sure if really diving into making it a stellar iPad app is worth it.

I also tried enabling macOS support, but that is going to require a lot more work. Again, not sure if it's worth it. But I will explore it a bit more. Need to research some more if there are better ways to make cross-platform apps without a ton of `#if os(iOS)` and whatnot.
