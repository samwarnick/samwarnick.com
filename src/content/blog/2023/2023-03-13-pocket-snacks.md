I've been putting a [little notebook](https://www.jetpens.com/Life-Noble-Notebook-Mini-Ring-5-x-3.1-7-mm-Rule/pd/20213) in my shirt pocket lately. I like having something around that I can take notes, write out tasks, etc. without getting distracted by my phone. I also like it because it's thin. Not as thin as a Field Notes or other pocket notebook, but I like the spiral bind way better.

The other day, I was sitting on the couch. I got to thinking, what else can I put in my shirt pocket? What about snacks?

After some research, it looks like most snacks are too tall, thick, or otherwise bulky to fit comfortably in my pocket.

Time to take things into my own hands.

## The Pocket Square

I decided to prototype my ideal snack. My wife came up with the best name for it. Introducing the Pocket Square.

It's a basic peanut butter chocolate chip granola bar, but rolled out as thin as I could get it. It ended up being about 4mm. Since it's so thin, it fits very nicely into my shirt pocket. Success.

## What doesn't work

It's too soft. Even after a night in the freezer, it still pretty soft since it's mostly peanut butter. It would easily melt and get gross if I actually put it in my pocket and went outside. I could tweak the recipe a bit to get the consistency better, but I'm still worried about how it would hold up. So I don't know that a granola bar is the best fit for a pocket snack. I still love it. The size is perfect.

I'm going to keep thinking about this and go to the grocery store for research.
