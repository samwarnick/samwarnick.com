Sort of a big day. I decided to be not patient and soft launched ScreenCred! Don't tell anyone yet ðŸ¤«.

I wanted to make sure things like the App Clip work in the wild. I also wanted to make sure the website was all up to date with App Store badge links and whatnot.

Going to test things and sit with it for a couple days. Then I will announce it to the 4 people that care. Might email some blogs. We'll see. I'm not big on that stuff. But I suppose I should be if this is what I want to do for my living one day.
