I'm spiraling out of control! In the past like 5 days I've started like 10 projects. To name a few:

- giving Neovim another shot, including starting my config from scratch,
- started a SvelteKit project to help manage my savings,
- started rewriting my ScreenCred image generation code in Go,
- started rewriting my ScreenCred image generation code in JS to not use puppeteer.

I need to take some deep breaths. I'm distracted. Even as I'm trying to write this I'm getting caught up writing some code. Getting ScreenCred released has obviously left a void in me that I'm not totally sure how to fill. I was singularly focused on ScreenCred for quite a while, but now I'm not, but maybe I still should be?

I think I need to make a list and prioritize.
