Finally made myself work on ScreenCred!

I'm trying to get things polished up to release someday "soon"—or at least a public TestFlight. So, crossing things off my list.

I fixed a bug on iPad. Apparently the background images were covering some buttons somehow...even though they were clipped. Maybe a hack, but I just threw `.allowsHitTesting(false)` on them and now it works. Win. Easier than I thought it was going to be.

Then I started polishing, or at least moving things around, in my settings screens.

Small change, but instead of a toggle for where to open details in, I'm trying a segmented control. I think it's a little more clear. But I might need to add some additional text to explain which details I'm talking about and whatnot.

Worked a bit on the about view as well. Mostly just moved things around, but I think it looks slightly nicer.

Anyway, feels good to get back into the swing of things. Now I'm off to soccer practice. Not my practice, but my 6 year-old's practice. She's much better than me.
