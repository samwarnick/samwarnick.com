I'm experimenting with a new style:

Not sure if I'm going to stick with it or not. But I like it. I want my apps to feel a little more custom.

I started to migrate more things to this style, but I ran into the most random issue. I'm unable to make custom `ButtonStyle`s. I've tried in a new blank project and it works fine, but not in my project. I have no clue why. It just says, `does not conform to protocol 'ButtonStyle'`. But it does...

I've tried clearing all my derived data and even reinstalling Xcode. Nothing.
