For reasons I don't want to get into now, I need a 3 hole punch for A5 sized paper. The [Amazon Basics 3 Hole Punch, Semi-Adjustable, 30 Sheet Capacity, Black](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VVB87Y1?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) seemed to fit the requirements. With the appealing advertised capacity and the amount of adjustment available for the holes and alignment guide, I thought this would be just right. But, I was wrong. It's being returned.

My first impressions after getting it out of the box were positive. It has some weight to it and feels solid.

However, the first hole punch was disappointing.

It left some dark residue. One white paper, it's really noticeable. Maybe this will clear up after more use, but not a great first experience.

The next thing I noticed was the alignment guide.

You can't tell from the picture, but the alignment guide has notches, so it kinda locks into place when you get to one of the presets. It has notches for if your paper is 8 inches, 8 ½ inches, or 220mm, and so on. The problem? A5 paper is _210mm_. Which is right in the middle of the 8 inch and 8 ½ inch notches. It's a bit difficult to keep at 210mm. It can easily be knocked into another notch and you alignment is now off.

Not the end of the world. I could live if the holes weren't perfectly centered and aligned. I could make the 8 ½ inch notch work if I had to.

Then I noticed that the holes are inset quite a bit more than my other hole punch. It's about ⅛" difference. That's quite a bit when you're dealing with a small A5 sized sheet. This was the biggest down side for me.

So all these things combined, this hole punch is going back in the box and being returned. The search continues.
