Was kinda in a funk today. Took on a task that was maybe a bit beyond my energy level today. I'm trying to make the images shrink as you scroll up. I have a `GeometryReader` updating a `PreferenceKey` as you scroll. The problem is that the size adjustment changes the position of my measurement view in the scroll view. I think this is because my header is in a `safeAreaInset`. I may need to change my header to be in a `ZStack` or something.

I'm not quite sure what else to try. Using `safeAreaInset` seems to be the right choice for this layout, but obviously is causing issues. Even if I use the global coordinate space instead of a named/local one, the offset does not seem to change "smoothly". So probably going to need to try some different layouts.
