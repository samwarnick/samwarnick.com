As part of the redesign, I wanted to add the ability to select an accent color. But I also got it in my mind to have a random option where the accent color will change every time you open the app.

This was my first attempt. A simple picker. 2 things I don't like about this:

1. You can't preview the color.
2. You don't know which colors are included in "random".

I started thinking of a way I could create a multi-select color picker. This is what I came up with:

I'm not 100% sold on this idea, but I like it. If you have multiple colors selected, then the app will randomly pick one each time it opens. If you have a single color selected, the app will only use that color. One issue I ran into was how to ensure at least one color was selected. I didn't really want to pop up an alert if you deselected them all or something like that. So I decided to go with disabling the last selected color so you can't deselect it. Not sure this is the best idea or not.

Overall though, I like this idea of having multiple accent colors and seeing a new one each time I open the app. I might scrap this color picker and switch to some preset "themes", or collections of a few colors. That would get around the issue of deselecting all the colors. Could make a theme builder too.
