I submitted version 1.1 of ScreenCred for review this morning. It's got a couple small updates:

- Shared with You! See ScreenCred links shared with you in Messages right in the app.
- Images are now cached better, so you shouldn’t see them load every time you open the app.
- Fixed a layout issue when ScreenCred opens from a link.

Yesterday, I woke up early and got all geared up to do battle with that layout issue. Took me 5 minutes. The issue turned out to be quite simple. I use an invisible view to essentially measure and determine if the app should be in a more vertical layout for when text is very large. The problem was that when you opened the app from a link, the Views that were used to determine this, were not there, so it always opened in the vertical layout. How did I find this out? Just made the view not invisible for a bit. Surprisingly simple to both debug and fix.

So look out for v1.1 coming soon!
