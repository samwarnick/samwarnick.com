I was having trouble figuring out [Boutique](https://github.com/mergesort/Boutique). I had used it in a test project and had no issues getting the store initialized. But this time, I kept getting an error preventing me from even building:

![An error in Xcode that says "No exact matches in call to initializer"](/media/2023-01-09-cryptic-error.png "Ummm, I'm pretty sure you're wrong Xcode?")

This took me far too long to figure out. Turns out, the model for a `Store` has to have a cache key that is a _`String`_. Mine were `Int`. If I had looked at the signature more carefully, I would've noticed this. But the docs said `Identifiable` was fine. But apparently that is only fine if the id is a `String`. Now I know. But seems like there could've been a more helpful error.

But after that, it was really simple to get recent searches working!

![A screen recording showing how searches are persisted so you can see your recent searches when starting a new search](/media/2023-01-09-recent-searches.gif "Magic!")

It's pretty simple. When a comparison kicks off, I save the two pieces of media involved. I limit the number of recent searches to 6. I also make sure the same piece of media is not added twice.

Probably could've implemented this a ton of ways, but I wanted to give Boutique more of a try, and I have some other uses for it in mind too.

Still need a real name for this thing. The working title is Bacon. Like, [six degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon)...get it? I'm really clever.
