Finally got a couple things done on ScreenCred. Fixed a couple bugs that were...bugging me.

I updated the search sorting a bit. I was finding TMDb's sorting of results a bit odd. I previously updated it to sort by popularity. Now, if a title matches the query exactly, it will be at the top. I also prioritize matches that contain the exact text of the query. Other than that, still sorts by priority.

I was also having a bug where the toolbar would think the keyboard was still there after dismissing search. This only happened on device, not simulator. For now I put in a little hack to dismiss the keyboard manually before dismissing the sheet. Seems to be related to using `.searchable`, which does not give access to the focus state of the search field—as far as I know.

With those 2 pesky bugs off my plate, I think I will start on iPad support next week.
