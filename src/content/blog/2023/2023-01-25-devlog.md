I'll be brief because kids are crying and we need to eat dinner soon.

I did a small revamp of history. I was storing each time a comparison ran, even if the two movies or shows were exactly the same. So first, I added a toggle to hide duplicates. Then I started on deletion. I wanted to show all items when you went to delete them. It started to get a bit unwieldy. So I removed that setting. Back to seeing all your comparisons. Then I decided, instead of adding a new entry each time, if there is an existing one, update the history item. Maybe I can add a counter for the number of times those two were compared or something.

Anyway, came full circle a couple times, but happy where I landed.

Did have a strange issue with `EditMode` where the environment was not being set how I would expect. I ended up having to declare my own `EditMode` state and then pass that as an environment to `EditButton` and my `List`. Otherwise, my `History` View had no idea if the list was editing or not.

```swift
struct History: View {
    @State var editMode: EditMode = .inactive

    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(historyItems) { historyItem in
                ...
            }
            .onDelete { indexSet in
                ...
            }
        }
        .environment(\.editMode, $editMode)
        .navigationTitle("History")
        .toolbar {
            ToolbarItem(placement: .primaryAction) {
                EditButton()
                    .environment(\.editMode, $editMode)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
