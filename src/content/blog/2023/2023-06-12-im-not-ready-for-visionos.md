visionOS and the idea of spatial computing are pretty exciting. But as a mostly hobbyist iOS developer, I'm already a bit exhausted thinking about a new platform.

To make great apps, indie and solo devs already have a long list of skills and APIs they need to excel at. For myself, I'm a little worried about what visionOS and spatial computing is going to add to that list. I've started working through the related WWDC videos, and sure, a lot of what you know already will apply to visionOSâ€”especially with SwiftUI. But it seems like to make truly great experiences, you're probably going to also need to know 3D modeling, how to write custom Metal shaders, really understand ARKit, and more.

I'm sure there are people who are going to be able to keep up and master all this and be incredibly successful. And maybe what Apple provides will make all this way easier than I'm expecting. The baseline of people's expectations of what an app provides seems to go up and up each year. I'm a little worried if I can keep up. Maybe I don't need to, but at this moment, it feels a bit daunting.

Of course, this is coming from someone who doesn't have any apps on the App Store and spends only a couple hours a week on making apps.
