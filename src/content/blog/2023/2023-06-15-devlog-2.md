Quick report. Been going through ScreenCred with Voice Over and on an iPhone 13 mini simulator with Accessibility Extra Extra Extra Large Dynamic Type enabled. So far I have found about 30 things that need to be fixed and improved. Most are small, simple things. Others are going to require new designs at larger text sizes. I'll get those fixed and then go through it all again.
