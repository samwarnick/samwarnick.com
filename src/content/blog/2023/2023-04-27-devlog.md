I decided to do the themes or color collections or whatever.

I like this. Gets rid of a lot of the issues I had before. I started with the basic system colors, but there's opportunity to add a lot of custom colors. Eventually down the line, I think I'll add a theme builder or something.

Anyway, that's what I've been up to. I'm sick, so this is all I have energy to write.
