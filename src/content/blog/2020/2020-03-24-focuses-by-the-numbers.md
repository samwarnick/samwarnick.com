Here are a few numbers related to making Focuses that may or may not be interesting.

## 130 hours

This is the first project I have time tracked. The first commit for Focuses was on December 13, 2019. About 13 weeks later I submitted it for review. So that's about 10 hours a week. Some weeks were much less and some were much more. This also doesn't include times when I was thinking about the app when I couldn't sleep or showering and stuff like that. A lot of the work on Focuses was done early in the morning before I started work for my full-time job. 130 hours seems like a lot to me, but it's about 3 weeks of full time work.

## 147 tasks complete

I'm using Things to keep track of everything I'm working on for this app. This probably isn't _that_ useful of a number since my tasks ranged from "iPad" to "Fix accent color on focus edit sheet". But 147 sounds kind of impressive.

## 183 commits

A commit is every time I make a change to the code and save it to version control. Only about a dozen of these were of the "Uncomment code I commented out" variety. My build number is based on the number of commits on the master branch. Again, this number doesn't mean a whole lot because some commits were changing a single color and some were adding multiple views and data models at the same time.

## 19 minutes spent in "In Review"

This surprised me. I submitted it for review about 7 am on March 9. About 6 hours later it moved from "Waiting for Review" to "In Review". Then about 19 minutes later it moved into "Pending Developer Release".
