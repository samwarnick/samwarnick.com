My Apple Developer membership has expired. I didn’t have auto renew enabled and I just kept putting it off and now it’s expired. I don’t know if I’m going to renew it or not.

I started updating ScreenCred for iOS 26 and Liquid Glass. I liked the direction things were headed. But Liquid Glass seems in flux and not fully thought through. It works great in some situations and terribly in others—maybe even most. Honestly, I think it looks good in my app, and I was (am?) excited about the changes in ScreenCred.

But do I renew?

It’s $100/yr. Not incredibly expensive, but also not nothing. This might be the chance to just be done with iOS development. _Gasp_. I could really put my effort behind a web version of ScreenCred and my other apps. It’s nothing new to say that I really enjoy making iOS apps. I like Swift as a language. I like SwiftUI as a framework. I like using native apps. But beyond the code, the whole process can be incredibly frustrating and demoralizing. Many of my apps are rejected for not doing enough. The web can do as little as I want—great when you’re full of small ideas like me.

So I don’t know. With my membership expired, ScreenCred will be taken off the App Store. I doesn’t get used much and doesn’t make me money. I think I’m okay with that. It does make me a little sad though. I remember getting my first app on the App Store and how proud I felt. Feels more tangible to me than throwing something up on the Internet.

Big ol’ shrug emoji from me. But, chances are I’ll leave it expired since it involves an amount of work to renew it.
