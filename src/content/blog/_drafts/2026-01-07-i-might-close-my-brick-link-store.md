title: I Might Close My BrickLink Store

I opened my BrickLink store—[Lemon Point Bricks](https://store.bricklink.com/samwarnick#/shop)—about 2 years ago. I've had 32 orders in that time. Overall, it's been a pretty fun, money losing endeavor. Each order makes a small amount of money, but I'm still in the hole from initial inventory and supplies. I've got about 17,000 parts in my inventory. Pretty small in the grand scheme of things. But, that's a lot of pieces locked up in store inventory, that _could_ be in personal inventory.

I've got a couple options.

## 1. Grow

Competition for new parts on BrickLink is tough. It's a commodity. To show up in searches, you either need a lot of variety of parts or a lot of a single part. Ideally both. I have neither. To get orders at all, I have to drop my prices a lot. I don't mind because I'm doing it for fun. I could get more serious about it and scale up my inventory. Space in my home is a real issue that would make this difficult.

## 2. Close

On the opposite end, I could just shut down the store. This would relieve my anxiety of missing an order and give me a bunch of new parts to play with. But, it is fun to package things up and mail them—that's really why I started. But this is a simple and appealing option.

## 3. Scale Back

here's opportunity to scale back. As I've written about before, [minifigs sell](https://samwarnick.com/blog/minifigs-sell/). I sold all my Star Wars, Marvel, and Ninjago minifigs in the first few months. But, I still have a bunch of others that will probably never sell. So I could buy sets, keep the bricks for myself, and put the minifigs in the store. This might work well for some themes like Marvel and Star Wars, but less well for other themes.

As I write this, I think I'm leaning towards scaling back and only keeping minifigs in the store inventory. Try that for a year or so and see how it goes. This would make parting out sets easier. I haven't added new parts to my store in a long time because it's a lot of work. How I organize for the store is way more granular than how I organize for myself.

But I'm still mulling over if I should just close the store. Since orders are so infrequent, I'm always nervous I'm going to miss something. I haven't yet, but never say never.
