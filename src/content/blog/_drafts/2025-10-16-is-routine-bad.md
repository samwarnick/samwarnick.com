Buckle up for a ramble.

Here’s something you’d never expect from me: I feel burnt out. I know, shocking. I’m never burnt out. I just don’t feel like doing anything.

I’m starting to think that my daily routine is contributing to it. Somewhat out of necessity, my days are pretty structured and consistent:

- Wake up around 6am, get kids fed and ready for school
- Take kids to school and go for a walk or run
- Come home and get ready for work
- Work
- Lunch
- Work
- Wrangle kids and get ready for dinner
- Wrangle kids and get ready for bedtime
- Baths, piano practice, get kids in bed
- Zone out for a bit
- Watch a show or read with my wife
- Fall asleep around 10pm

There is not much variety. But I like my routine. It’s comfortable. Routines make things simple. When I have a routine, I do not have the cognitive overload of making many decisions about what I’m doing. But, having a routine seems to be almost like putting life on fast-forward. That, combined with the fact that I’m at home like 90% of the time—and most of that time is spent in my office—weeks just fly by.

There are very few breaks. Weekends are often tougher than the week because it’s 100% managing chaos. I have maybe an hour to myself in the evenings that is unstructured and unplanned. I don’t like diving into things then I can’t sleep and it ruins my routine. The breaks I do get I usually spend slacking instead of resting. I think rest is typically defined as an activity that feels restorative. My breaks are typically not that. I feel so low energy at the end of the day that anything other than watching TV feels like a chore.

I don’t know if my daily life routine causes me to burn out, but it definitely does not help. So maybe it is not the routine, but the lack of true rest.

So some things I am considering:
- Is my routine actually part of the problem?
- What can I do to add variety to each day so they don’t all feel the same?
- What activities are really restorative to me?
