My wife is helping start a Pokémon club at our library. I thought it would be fun to make a new booster pack each month to give out to the kids. So I started working on September.

They are pretty much just copies of the [Japanese Pokémon Gym Promo packs](https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/07/lapras-ex-chikorita-hole-diggin-shovel-and-other-gym-promos-revealed-for-august-changes-to-promo-packs). I had never seen them before, but instantly fell in love with how they look. So copied them in Affinity Designer. I’m not a very good graphic designer, so I usually need to “borrow” tried and true designs. These are just for fun anyway.

While the green color is pretty good, it is not what I was expecting. That sent me down a rabbit hole.

I first thought my printer was just bad. I have a Canon PIXMA TS9120 from about 2018. Went to Staples and had some samples printed, and they were worse.

I went through and made sure all my color profiles were correct and that I was using CMYK and all that. Nothing I changed there affected the output. AFAIK, printers are pretty good at converting when they need to.

Then I had the thought. Paper. Paper can be a huge variable. So I printed the same thing on nice glossy photo paper and my cheap copy paper.

The glossy paper is able to print far more vibrant colors compared to my cheap Target copy paper.

I then found a Soft Proof layer you can add in Affinity Designer that does a decent job of simulating what it will look like printed. If you’re able to get a proper profile for your printer and paper, it will look even better, especially if your monitor is calibrated.

I used a lot of ink experimenting. But I'm not mad. It's important to understand the constraints of what you are working with. Sure, it's disappointing that I can't get the exact color of green on the paper I want, but that's part of the design challenge. I’ll be experimenting more with other papers. I need something in the 24 to 28 Lb range for easy folding. Excited to see what I find and I’m excited to make more of these booster packs!
