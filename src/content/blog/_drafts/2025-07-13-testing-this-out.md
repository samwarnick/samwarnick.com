I just felt like posting something. So here are some random thoughts for this Friday evening.

1. A car was on fire in the middle of the road as I was getting my recycling bin. Kinda wild, but not the first time I've gone out to the road and something was on fire.
2. I just finished [_Gathering Moss_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/gathering-moss-a-natural-and-cultural-history-of-mosses-robin-wall-kimmerer/8632077?ean=9780870714993&next=t). Great little book that makes me think about noticing the small things. One part that got me thinking was when the author talked about fractals. Life is fractals. Moss is like a self-contained rainforest. Made me think, what is a rainforest a smaller version of?
3. I've been reading a lot more. I've talked about how my hobbies come in waves. I previously would've felt frustrated by stopping one hobby to spend more time on another, but I'm just going with it now.  Yes, I wish I had the capacity to do everything all the time, but I don't. I'll read a bunch of books now, and when that wanes, who knows what I'll pick up next. It'll be exciting to see!
4. My deck door is leaking again and I don't know how to fix it. Sort of an edge can because rain doesn't often come from that direction but still annoying.
5. That's it.
