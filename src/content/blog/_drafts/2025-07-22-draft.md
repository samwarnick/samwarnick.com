I’m in between projects at the moment. I spent a couple days tearing down my desk to try different setups. TL;DR it's basically back to how it was, except my PC is now plugged into my TV. “In between projects” implies I know what’s next, but I don't. There’s a lot of things I could be doing right now:

- Part out some LEGO sets to add more parts to my Bricklink store.
- Sort Pokemon cards.
- Watch a show or movie.
- Play Mario Kart World.
- Work on iOS 26 changes to ScreenCred.
- Get some things ready to sell.
- Read.
- Listen to a podcast.
- Exercise.

All of those would be pretty good things to do. Some of them are probably more of _should dos_. But nothing sounds interesting. I’m bored, but I don’t want to do anything. I’ll probably lay in bed and mindlessly scroll the internet. Just one of those days, you know? Sometimes I just get tired of all my usual leisure activities.

So I’m just killing time until something piques my interest.
