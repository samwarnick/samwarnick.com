title: Hannah's Game
---

My 3-year-old likes to watch me play Wordle. She asked me to make her a word game. So I did.

I went a bit off the rails and made a decently polished iOS app. At least _I_ think it's pretty good. Some friends made me put it on the App Store.

If iOS isn't your thing, there is also a [web version!](https://hannahsgame.samwarnick.com)
