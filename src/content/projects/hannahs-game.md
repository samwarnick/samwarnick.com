title: Hannah's Game
---

My 3yo likes to watch me play Wordle. She asked me to make her a word game. So I did.

It originally started as an iOS app. Then I got shamed by [that article](https://rogueengine.io/blog/your-app-should-have-been-a-website) that went around (one of many really.) So I decided to write it as a Svelte webapp. Just cause.

For this simple app, the only things I'm missing are spring animations and haptics. Other than that, it works pretty well!
