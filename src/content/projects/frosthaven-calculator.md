title: Frosthaven Calculator
---

My brother's gaming group wanted a calculator for Frosthaven. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure what it does, but I think it has something to do with calculating how much gold to upgrade a card for various conditions.

Made with [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev) and [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com) using the offical [Gloomhaven font](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1733586/files-for-creation).
