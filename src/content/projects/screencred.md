ScreenCred is an iOS app that helps you see who worked together on your favorite movies and shows. Basically, search 2 movies or shows and it'll show all the common cast and crew between the 2. Works with people too.

You can [read all about the development](/tags/screencred).

As far as I'm concerned, it's pretty feature complete. So I haven't touched it nearly a year. It has dozens of downloads. Why don't _you_ give it a try?
