I recently hit a 365 day streak in [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com). I've never been very good at keep a journal, so it felt pretty good! I found a couple things that helped journaling stick for me:

1. Keep it short.
2. Treat it like a private Instagram.

## Keep it short

I don't write everything that happened in the day. That would be boring to read any way. I usually just write a sentence or two about something that stuck out. And that's it. I just had to give myself permission to leave most of the day out.

## Treat it Like a Private Instagram

Any time I take a picture and think "I should post this to Instagram", I don't. Instead, later that night, I put it in Day One and write a little about it. It's just for me. By ignoring Instagram, I feel like I can be more present, and also spend zero mental energy thinking about everything involved with sharing a photo or video. Win-win.

After I made those two changes, I'm now pretty excited to write in my journal each night. I know I'll be glad I did in the years to come.
