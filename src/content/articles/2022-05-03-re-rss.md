Chris Coyier [blogged about RSS](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/04/29/rss-3/). Talking about how RSS can be social, he wrote:

"Slow social." I liked this. So, I guess instead of tapping a heart, I'm blogging about it.

RSS feels slow and deliberate. I've been thinking about being more deliberate in my life, so I like that idea. Not sure I have much more to say about RSS right now, but I wonder what else can be done with it. I like Twitter mentions and replies. I think IndieWeb and services like [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) can support this, but honestly I need to learn more about those and how they work.

RSS is cool though. I enjoy finding blogs to subscribe to.
